Bought calls on TMUS dip and they are up 70%."
2023-06-02,"When ATT started having issues a while back I sold all my telecom stocks (T & VZ). Seems like they've stopped innovating and have become strictly a dying service provider like cable. Google is trying telecom and VZ is trying home internet. 

IMO they have to cut their losses and bundle up with other big companies. Amazon joining with one of these providers makes sense. Would not be surprised is Tesla joins in too since they have starlink. 

What other way can telecom maximize profits?"
2023-06-02,Amazon needs to be disbanded.
2023-06-02,Amazon and T-Mobile denied this
2023-06-02,I would absolutely renew my membership if they do something like this. Currently $139 is impossible to justify for me since it encourages spending even more on Amazon.

2023-06-02,"I don't think I would trust Amazon as my wireless MVNO anymore than I would trust Google to be my ISP.

2023-06-03,Amazon needs those unwanted babies  to grow up to work their fulfillment centers.
2023-06-30,Why is this a problem? Amazon was upfront about that when you signed up as a seller.
2023-07-14,I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt even look this year but my condo building just sent out an email begging people to pick up their Amazon packages because the office is too full so I guess lots of people shopped lll
2023-07-14,"Wow people liked it that much huh? To me it was pretty bad. Amazon more and more is just becoming a flea market with generic products made in China. If I want that I can go on eBay or Baba, both way cheaper."

2023-07-17,"Former Amazon driver here. Saw this coming a mile away. When they rolled out the cameras and made everyone sign consent forms, I didn‚Äôt sign, and I was told I couldn‚Äôt work until I did. Amazon is a parasite, and the people running it belong in prison for the atrocious working conditions and egregious privacy violations, among other crimes."
2023-07-17,"So these leaks should be met with extremely harsh financial penalties to Amazon to disincentive this loss of privacy. Drivers should be able to sue Amazon, as well as regulatory penalties."
2023-07-18,"I worked for a much smaller company than Amazon that installed these in technicians vehicles in the name of safety.  Immediately it was used to question efficiency, second guess drivers (why'd you take that exit?), and abused by asshole managers for things like dress code and trying to see them when the truck was parked (you could activate the camera remotely under some conditions).

As far as driver safety, it did very little beside yell at you and make you paranoid. Ours didn't even have a dash cam so it wasn't useful for accident investigations or complaints.  I refused to do anything with it as a manager and as far as I know it never functioned as a safety tool."
2023-07-17,Amazon drivers need to fucking unionize
2023-07-19,"Amazon is definitely a sustainable full time job.

I've been selling Amazon for 10 years now.

First year, is always rough.  But things will get better from there as you learn to source, analyze, and make connection with suppliers. Then you will see real growth.

You really need to be get to that 1 million + in revenue to have a pretty decent net profit income. You will get there as long as you put in your best effort and ""re-invest"" all profit.

I don't want to say how much I make but I have done Amazon since I was 21 and I am now 31 and still doing Amazon. I have accumulated 3 rentals property in CA and have a decent size stock portfolio. Could probably retire pretty happy now. All this was due to Amazon income. (But to be honest, 2020 and 2021 was the best years for Amazon, Probably made 35-40% of my net worth during those two years.)

Also, don't put all your eggs in one basket, Amazon could suspend your account one day and take everything away. So once you start making money, look for other avenue of money makers such as rentals/stocks. and build those out."
2023-07-20,"You have to remember one important thing about the ‚Äúgurus‚Äù‚Ä¶ their only motivation is to sell you a course. Integrity goes out the window. They will manipulate numbers in any way necessary for people to comment ‚ÄúTeach Me‚Äù or whatever bullshit they say on their posts.

Here‚Äôs the truth: if you turn a NET PROFIT of 10-13% with your Amazon business, you are in the top 10% of sellers. So, if you can make those numbers work for you where it‚Äôs worthwhile to do it, then carry on! But don‚Äôt believe a single thing you see on IG or TikTok. That‚Äôs only there to get you to commit $1k to their 5 session course or whatever bullshit they are selling."
2023-07-25,amazon should dump their retail operations into a new company and just focus on AWS
2023-07-25,Lol yeah right break up amazon they couldn‚Äôt even break up meta who has done more harm with it‚Äôs leading social media position but yeah ok lina you taking down amazon now üôÑ
2023-07-26,"I honestly don't see why Amazon needs the other 2 companies for this. One of the main reasons I use Google Maps is because it works so well with Google Assistant. Whether I am at home or away, I can ask Google to look up certain places, call certain places for me, get me directions, etc. 

Lots of people use Alexa as their chosen voice assistant at home, but Alexa doesn't do much when you're away from home. Basically useless for anything mobile other than playing music. Alexa would absolutely dominate if it had more use on the go... and having good, reliable mapping data is absolutely crucial to that."
2023-07-26,"I was using google maps a few days ago and as I was cruizing down the highway the nice google lady randomly chimed in and said ""There is a speed trap ahead"".  Wasnt sure what to think at first but I slowed down and sure enough in less then 30 seconds from her saying it there is a cop parked at a hidden spot between us and the oncoming lanes (twin highway separated by a narrow treeline).  

Sorry Meta, Microsoft and Amazon but yall are too late.  Definately sticking with gogle now üôÇ"
2023-07-28,"Assuming you didn‚Äôt have them sign a reseller agreement, your only real option is to join the brand registry on Amazon and send a cease and desist as a registered brand. 

Make your partners sign agreements moving forward. A good clause would be:

Unless explicitly stated otherwise and in writing, Authorized Resellers are not permitted to resell, promote, market, or advertise XYZ BRAND on third party marketplaces or aggregators such as, but not limited to, Amazon or Ebay. XYZ BRAND may withdraw its consent for an Authorized Reseller to utilize these platforms at any time and without advanced warning. XYZ BRAND expressly prohibits an Authorized Reseller from distributing inventory to an Unauthorized Reseller.

^ that last line is also important bc sometimes retailers will submit excess inventory to random Amazon aggregators."
2023-07-28,"I don't think it's an Amazon problem per say. What I'm assuming happened is that someone at the retail company was tasked to put X amount of articles/listings online (""all of the shoes we sell""), but upper management missed that your brand shouldn't be part of it. While this is a breach of your contract with the retailer, it's not something you could take down for a DMCA request or else. Amazon isn't at fault.

Contact the retailer, tell them to remove the product online as it's a breach of contract. Also tell them if they don't comply by date X, you will stop supplying them. If it doesn't work, have your lawyer contact them as well."
2023-07-29,"I would ask myself if the revenue is worth losing. 

I don't know what your concern is about having a 3rd part selling your product on Amazon, but if the volume is high with this retailer, are you prepared to lose their business? It is likely that your only real recourse is to stop selling to them."
2023-07-28,"You can make an account with Amazon and demonstrate that you are the owner of that brand, then tell them to remove the other brand. Furthermore, you can stop supplying the seller completely and tell them that the relationship will be terminated if they continue"
2023-07-29,"Contact the dealer and tell them to remove the listings and they are not authorized to sell there. If they say ‚Äúbut you didn‚Äôt tell me that before‚Äù, you say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre right but I am now.‚Äù It‚Äôs that simple. If they don‚Äôt like it or refuse, cut them off and never sell them another product.

Source: I have manufacturers I deal with that specify their dealers cannot sell on Amazon, eBay etc"
2023-08-02,This isn‚Äôt gonna work and might be the worst business model ever. You have no USP and Amazon probably buy from the same wholesaler and then sell on at cost. While you have to pay them 30% for hosting your sale.
2023-08-02,"It can be hard to find any with good profit margins. I buy books wholesale for my website. The wholesalers sell on a Amazon for just a few dollars over wholesale. I'd be losing money of I matched their prices.

Some books, I can get cheaper on Amazon than I can buy them wholesale. I think that's due to retail arbitrage."
2023-08-02,"Not to mention, Amazon literally started as a book store. I wonder how hard they are to compete with"
2023-08-03,Amazon the money printer got damn the amount of money they move is insane.

2023-08-04,"I thought nobody would talk about this one gem, but a reporter brought it up in the earnings call‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

2023-08-03,"There was a period where people here were like ""oo I dont buy from amazon, its a chinese flea market, blah blah blah""

Well, guess they had a nice cup of shutting the fuck up. Folks who were paying attention knew that as soon as AMZN backed off capex spend when they over built, they would have this massive advantage for online sales. I literally can not go a week without Prime. I order most things off prime, its such a wide selection, and I don't have to drive to wait a week for delivery. 

Also, the $10B rev for advertising services. That's the next AWS."
2023-08-23,"I sell a lot on Amazon and eBay in a specific niche.
In all orders I include a 4x6 mailer with QR code offering 10% discount for next order on my direct website.

Amazon is a great tool to find new customers, but direct website sales are always the most profitable and preferred."
2023-08-23,"Let me break down my experience with Amazon for you friend. 

&#x200B;

A few years ago I was selling many things on Amazon, anything really I could get my hands on. There was a bundle set of rolling papers that we had purchased from verified suppliers by the manufacturer. at the time we were doing around 3-4k every two weeks. A listing, and not a product had IP ownership. We got our Amazon account suspended and after gathering all the evidence required (which took weeks) Chasing down invoices, asking suppliers for signed letters to prove authenticity, sending multiple emails explaining the situation. We eventually got our account banned for life.

&#x200B;

Amazon then proceeded to keep 3.8k of our monies (bare in mind this is years ago) and we still have not seen a single penny. We chase this up every few months but due to Amazons terms it is not illegal what they do. 

&#x200B;

My two cents. Selling for Amazon is working for Amazon. You follow Amazon metrics, you answer to them when mistakes come up. Customers win 99% percent of cases even if you can prove them wrong. The fees are MASSIVE, the competition is steep and most of the time you are battling with a manufacture/supplier of the product who sells under a different name to make more profit.

&#x200B;

All in all, sell for yourself, grow for yourself and make your own dreams come true. Remember you are an entrepreneur for a reason and it is not to work for someone else again. 

&#x200B;

TL/DR: Amazon stole from me, taught me a valuable lesson and left me salty."
2023-08-23,"If you‚Äôre ‚Äònot good at google ad search‚Äô what makes you believe you‚Äôre going to do better in Amazon paid ads?

Amazon & Shopify are complements, not alternatives. If one doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs a sign that the other won‚Äôt work either. But if one works, it‚Äôs a sign that the other will work well, too.

Big difference: Amazon takes a way higher cut than Shopify. Be prepared to pay 30% of your sales price to Amazon. You need to decide if you have the margin factored in to be able to afford that"
2023-08-23,"Have you thought about doing both? Keeping your shopify store but also starting Amazon and adding that link to your shopify store?

My site is very new but i've seen people visit my site then click on the amazon link to buy there. 

I would also consider creating more of a content-rich landing page on your online store with options to purchase after they scroll down. So people that see an ad will then go to your landing page where you can ""prime"" them using content. What type of content? Use amazing photos (both product and lifestyle - stuff you see in magazines) and ""social proof"" which are photos and videos of evidence that people are interacting with your product and brand (this is the thing that is missing from most online stores). Send all of your digital traffic generated by ads to that landing page then let them decide where to buy.

Try that for a few months."
2023-08-24,"This is just me, but there are basically two sites where I shop: Amazon or Walmart. I'm not gonna go to 20 different websites to get what I need.  I get free shipping at Amazon and Walmart; I know that they'll stand behind the purchase if something goes wrong; and there are very few independent sites that can beat the Amazon/Walmart price. Besides nine times out of ten the independent site is just dropshipping it from China too. So, there's not any sort of ""buy local"" value there. I'll just let Amazon/Walmart dropship it from China with a smaller markup."
2023-08-23,We focused on own shop first. Fb ads. Made lots of sales but it was always just above break even with all ad costs (cpm). Started selling on a local marketplace site (like amazon) who charges commision on sale. Like a cpa system. You only pay when you sell something. Again lots of sales but with predetermined margins. Meanwhile our shop is still online but without ads only a few sales per month. Now we have some headroom moneywise and are preparing to spool up ads for the shop again.
2023-08-28,"My friend is working as a dev for Amazon and they are trying like hell to get him to stay, but refuse to budge on the return to office policy. They're gonna lose him for certain."
2023-08-28,"I mean, companies that embrace remote work are going to suck up any talented employees who decide to leave Amazon. Plus they'll save tons of money on not having to lease an office space. It's really that simple."
2023-09-11,"Firstly you have to fully comprehend the blue cross √áA. It‚Äôs a very very small % of what they fulfill. Tbh it‚Äôs like $100 to a billionaire. On the top and bottom line they still win. CVS owns the entire customer health lifecycle. Insurance -> servicing patients, to fulfillment. If you can‚Äôt grasp this then don‚Äôt invest. Company produces so much $$ Amazon only does off brand fulfillments and they are in no shape to compete. Look at whole foods. They don‚Äôt even come close to the big boys."
2023-09-12,"CVS is a well run company currently at a great price. All of its Bears used the Aetna purchase back in 2018 too knock the company but CVS has since proved many wrong. Their health insurance purchases have created the perfect synergy for their PBM‚Äôs. CVS can essentially offer better cost cutting prescriptions than their competitors because they cut out the middle man. 

The only big con to consider is Amazon being allowed to enter the PBM business. CVS recently lost some contracts. I think it was Anthem blue cross in CA? Eventually Amazon will own and distribute everything. I don‚Äôt see how there‚Äôs any chance the smaller pbm‚Äôs like Walgreens or Rite Aid any chance to survive."
2023-09-22,"Prime Video was the only reason I was keeping Prime (watching it now). I guess it is time to cancel. Thank you Amazon for saving me money, I guess."
2023-09-24,"It depends on your risk tolerance. Just like any business every sales channel has its own risk factors. 

Amazon - they own your customer but there are hundreds of millions of customers on the platform. They store and fulfill your orders. But again, they own the customer not you.

Shopify - you are responsible for traffic to your website and products but you own the customer (ie email, address and phone number). You will need a 3PL (3rd party logistics - think Amazon fulfillment but a private company) to fulfill your orders. It can be difficult to get traffic to your website/products.

Best case would have a mix of both to mitigate your risk. More and more of the aggregators in the space are looking for a mix of both rather than just 100% Amazon only. 

Even more, products with (subscription) monthly recurring revenue are even more attractive, ie something consumable that needs to be ordered monthly like supplements. 

That doesn‚Äôt mean a business without a 2nd sales channel is a bad business. You can always build out that 2nd sales channel. It‚Äôs very dependent from business to business. 

DM me if you have any more questions. Hope this helps."
2023-09-25,"There are buyers that specialize in buying ecom and even specifically Amazon FBA ecom.

As someone just getting into it, you‚Äôre looking at the scraps, or companies that are so young they aren‚Äôt even on their radar, although, most likely the former."
2023-09-25,"What stops me from buying a Amazon FBA business is the low margins and Amazon's lack of seller support. After COGS, FBA fees/ads you're likely sub 20% margin. They will shut your account down (sometimes due to violations of seller policies,  like primary photo not having an all white background) and just showing thr item. You'll have to fight to get it back. Could take weeks or months to get it back, meanwhile you're entire revenue source is shut down.

There are ways to mitigate other risks, like branding, to report knock offs and listing hijacking. As others have mentioned, you have benefits like massive audience and your audience is mostly at the bottom of the sales funnel.  

I would be more inclined to buy a FBA business if I was very adept at expanding product channels, like to my own website and I owned other website that I could point existing and well trafficked articles (organic traffic) to my product website. Being solely beholden to the whims of one corporation sounds like a huge risk to me.


I would recommend listening to some podcasts about Amazon FBA businesses from actual owners and advertising managers."
2023-09-25,"1/ Amazon invests $$$ into Anthropic
2/ Anthropic then uses that money to pay for AWS usage
3/ Amazon reports large growth in AWS division

Reminds me of how Nvidia ‚Äòinvests‚Äô in AI startups that just so happen to need to purchase thousands of Nvidia chips"
2023-09-25,"The investment is unlikely to be $4B  cash, or even stock, but likely to be AWS Credits or similar not-really-money-or-event-value investment. 

Because otherwise they would probably disclosed the investment structure a bit more... it's like Amazon is paying with something that's not ""true value""."
2023-09-25,"This is really smart. 

Claude is appears to be more accurate than the latest versions of GPT, which seems to have lost effectiveness recently perhaps because of over fitting to safety. 

Anthropic seems to be more focused on the enterprise applications of this powerful technology, opposed to the OpenAI focus on the consumer,  so it makes sense that Amazon would be keen to enter into this partnership.

Amazon already has substantial expertise in chip design so having access to a real world use cases means they will have a quick feedback loop for improvement. 

And 4B seems like a pretty good value, considering MS paid 10B for a similar foothold. 

Seems like a good step."
2023-09-26,"> The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon ‚Äúunlawfully maintains‚Äù its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.

>Amazon also ‚Äúeffectively requires‚Äù that sellers use its ‚Äúcostly‚Äù fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.

This is going to be a pretty interesting one to watch."

2023-09-26,"I will wait to see more of the details, but this seems to have a lot more substance than the ATVI lawsuit. I am sure there is a legitimate question about at what point market dominance becomes unfair. At an intuitive level it seems that Amazon probably has, and that this is to the detriment of its customers and sellers, but I expect that there are some devils in the details."
2023-09-26,"Tbh the lawsuit is not wrong. I've been surprised how expensive most products are these days when about 10 years ago ordering online was always way way cheaper than buying in stores. 

(And I am not referring to inflation. Relative price online vs in stores is probably the lowest it's been because of Amazon)"
2023-09-26,"I assume that they have more 'firepower' that they think will win them the case, because I'm not sure how anything outlined in the article is even remotely surprising. If anyone was going to have a case against amazon to begin with, it would probably have to extend far beyond the e-commerce wing of their business. Amazon's defense to this is literally 'if you claim that we are hurting other online retailers AND sellers on our site, why don't they just work together instead? We aren't preventing them from doing so.' The prongs on their 'attack' almost seem to be contradictory. 

  
And it seems like Amazon is this Khan's white whale. I'm sure the company's lawyers will have fun twisting that in their favor. (Not shilling for Amazon, I don't own any shares. In fact, I'd love if the stock dropped a ton, so I could open a position at a discount)"

2023-10-05,"As a seller on Amazon, they will literally run ur prices into the ground so you make nothing, until you are off the listing and then raise their prices back up shortly after.

If they see a product is selling well and they aren‚Äôt selling it, they will start selling it shortly after‚Ä¶ undercutting everyone on the listing.

They are the main sellers in their 3rd party marketplace not being a 3rd party"
2023-10-05,"They're alleging that Amazon was using an algorithm that would scrape competitors websites and then *manipulate* the competition's pricing algorithms to push the price higher (presumably through changing Amazon's price and deducing how the competitors price would change?). So Amazon ends up being the cheapest because they trick other websites into going higher and then undercut it?

In a non-digital marketplace, is that illegal? Like, if you think Bob across the street is going to raise his price if you do it, and then while Bob's out to lunch you drop your price down to normal so you're the cheapest again, can you do that? I feel like the problem is that Amazon doesn't actually have any secret knowledge. They can reframe this as competition tripping over their own feet. If Amazon uses some new algorithm, and then competitors prices all start going wonky trying to keep up with it, is that Amazon's fault?

I think it's deeply unethical, but are there existing regulations that cover this or do we need to write some new ones? How do you stop Amazon's lawyers from saying ""We don't control their prices, we just respond to them""?"

It used to be a place where I would learn every day. Where I would invent every day. I would get new ideas and try new tech every single day. Now it just feels like everyone is trying to keep their heads above the water."
2023-10-20,"The problem is that this is obviously a stealth layoff.  Amazon stock is only up 6% from a year ago so they need more people to leave.

It's one thing if you never moved away and can easily show up.  It's another thing if you moved your family during the pandemic and after you moved back to accommodate this request, they fire you anyway. 

If they fire you for this, they were going to fire you after you moved back anyway, so I'd just tell them to fire me if they want, they'll still end up with a lawsuit anyway."
2023-10-31,Follow Amazon's guidelines. It's not worth risking your listing.
2023-10-31,"Amazon has strict guidelines for main product images. While competitors might get away with it temporarily, it can lead to listing suppression. Even if others are doing it, it's best to stay compliant and use other images in the listing to show the caddy in use."
2023-10-31,"Been there! Thought about doing the same for my product. But then I realized, just because everyone's jumping off a bridge doesn't mean I should too. I'd stick to Amazon's guidelines."
2023-10-31,"Playing fast and loose with Amazon's rules? Risky move! Maybe stick to the straight and narrow on the main pic, but get creative with the rest?"
2023-10-31,Just make sure to clearly put into the description it doesn‚Äôt include props cause I worked for Amazon customer service and people are idiots
2023-10-31,"interesting seeing the negative responses here. We‚Äôve been doing it to great effect. I went to Amazon Accelerate in Seattle, and the Amazon team themselves used this as an example in a presentation on how to increase conversion on listings"
2023-11-19,"I was selling on Amazon, my staff was working hard to fulfill orders, and the vendors will thrilled with the amount we were buying.  But our wholesale cost is 50% or more of retail price, Amazon takes (I don't remember 15-20%).  And we had to sell under retail to be competitive, so I found there was little in there for us.  Also Amazon makes you take returns on used/broken items that weren't like that when you sent it out.  I got burned on a $800 item, customer returned a similar looking $300 item, still with the pricetags on it from the place he actually bought it.  Amazon told me to go fuck myself.  I decided at that point I didn't want to be in business with them.

We're admittedly small potatoes, so we didn't amount to anything to them.

One final word of caution; if what you're selling is popular Amazon will then go to China and have it made themselves and essentially tell you to go fuck yourself, maybe stealing your manufacturer to boot.

You might have a vastly different experience, I have no idea.  Just tread carefully."
2023-11-20,"I sold on Amazon for about 10 years before quitting when Covid hit. Through that time I also sold on my own website.

If you're trying to build a brand long term, stay away from Amazon. Yes you will get sales but your brand will get diluted and eventually usurped by Amazon if you are successful.

Riding the Amazon wave early on and quitting when I did was one of the best moves of my life. Was selling roughly $500k (total) per year when I started. $9M when I quit. $30M now.

Happy to provide what other insight I can."
2023-11-19,I am a fairly large Amazon Seller ($15M a year in sales). I would say that scale and diversification of products is the most important thing when considering becoming an Amazon seller now. There are so many hidden costs and unknowns (example Amazon stopping sales in a sku for no reason) that reducing costs in other places via scale (inbound shipping to Amazon) is really important and having lots of eggs in lots of different baskets.
2023-11-20,"The simple math says, the higher the margin you can get, the better it is to sell on Amazon - because it will give you much more exposure for a high-margin product.

If the margins are low, you're likely to lose money on Amazon, even at large scale"
2023-11-19,"I have an e commerce and Amazon store under the same name. I don't love Amazon but like you're sayin, the world is kind of going that way. We haven't used FBA as we fulfill ourselves. I'm sure you have already trademarked your name, but if you haven't, do so, and then you cans et up a proper branded Amazon page."
2023-11-20,"I inherited my dad's Amazon business. Back in the day, they made $2M in revenue. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Amazon allows direct from manufacturer competition, meaning you're competing with Chinese sellers direct to consumer. It is not possible to beat them, not with your markup. The only products still sustainable in our store is the stuff we manufacture ourselves, with our own brand registry. Just something to think about."
2023-11-20,"Amazon is starting to become not worth it.  Just when you figure it out, they change the rules and unless you have a unique product it is a financial race to the bottom."
2023-11-20,"This is my experience and others may vary. I am located in Canada

No.  When I tried to dip our companies toes into Amazon the numbers did not make sense. There was only a flat like $6 allowed for shipping costs. Yet my minimum cost to ship was about $18 at the time. So I had to add a further $12 minimum to the sell price. Which kept us competitive price wise. But the second I got orders that were a little further away the cost to ship would jump and it would chew away the profit. 

Add in the products I had on there are a bit niche and 95% of the sales were at Xmas it really was not worth the headache so I shut it down. Hindsight it was the correct move because now there are several main sellers doing the same products and they are doing it WAY cheaper than I ever could. Im not even sure how they manage to sell that cheap as their cost cant be any cheaper than mine is."
2023-11-29,"Translation: The data doesn't say what I want it to say.

Amazon runs metrics on everything. He should be laughed off the stage for claiming not to have data. No one is buying that."
2023-12-06,I‚Äôve got family and friends who work for Amazon and they were told they‚Äôd have a year to relocate. They all told the company they would do it but plan on just quitting once they actually have to.
2023-12-06,Thats the point. They quit and Amazon doesn‚Äôt have to give them severance when the eventual down sizing starts in 2024. Just yesterday Wells Fargo said they think their unexpected severance costs will be almost a billion dollars in the fourth quarter.
2023-12-08,"I've been doing this on and off lately.  Just my phone, my car keys, and my Amazon gloves.  It is kind of liberating!"
2023-12-11,"If it is jewelry for a small niche, I would suggest using esty. It is better and easier to compete when you are niche.  

Amazon FBA isn't as passive as most think and if your audience is small the algorithms will not help you, they are looking to blast your product for lots of sales.

Shopify while it would also work for your needs, is also a good amount of logistics and tweaking to get it to work for what sounds like a small payoff."
2023-12-11,Amazon needs approve you anyway so start with that. Shopify give you three months for a buck. It is like a hundred dollars to get all the work you want done in a few days.
2023-12-15,Amazon automation is typically a big scam. I can't speak to this company directly but as someone who works in the space and an ex seller I can tell you it is not 1-2 hours a week. 60% of FBA businesses fail in the 1st year and 84% in 5 years. It's very competitive and the Chinese factories are taking over. I've had friends ask me about my business and if they should get into it and I always tell them they missed the boat and tell them to find something else.
2023-12-16,"These have been around for years, and they're super sketchy.  If it was that easy to make money selling on Amazon, why would they bother spending time selling the *idea* of selling on Amazon to other people, when they could just be killing it themselves?

Also, all the info to start selling on Amazon is freely available.  Save the $50k for actual business expenses, like manufacturing or buying product to sell, advertising, shipping, etc."
2023-12-15,"what's the product? Unless it's some kind of branded apparel, or bed sheets, towels, or something (where the material is important) ...most people go on amazon and choose the cheapest. dont they? especially in these times, and increasingly in the future.

also bear in mind all these new competitors on the scene...shein, temu, etc. amazon are going to want to keep their spot. and will increasingly favour the cheaper options imo. over the next few years

$25 to $40 for better quality. on amazon. is a big jump. $30 for 'clearly' better quality/ better features seems more of a draw. depends on the product.

In the last 3 weeks (the busiest time of year) you've only had a few sales. which suggests an issue."
2023-12-15,">also bear in mind all these new competitors on the scene...shein, temu, etc. amazon are going to want to keep their spot. and will increasingly favour the cheaper options imo. over the next few years

It's a product similar product to a tool caddy.

Do you know as US sellers, if we have the opportunity to sell on these websites as well?  

Have you launched a lot of products on Amazon before?  You sound pretty confident that there's an issue.  Regarding the price, from the sellers selling them $40-65, mine is the highest quality for sure and they are selling between 200-700 a month depending on the seller for most of the higher priced ones.  

I agree with most people going for the cheaper ones in this economy, there also has been a TON of competition added to the cheaper ones since I started researching the product, however there does seem to be a market for the more expensive ones.

I did get one more sale today finally.  Could it be Amazon hasn't ranked me well yet?  I noticed that in JungleScout there's no data on my product."
2023-12-15,"Also, if you do think it‚Äôs the price and you were me (thinking this product is worth $45-65), what would your strategy be to get it selling at that price?  If I discount too far down, it‚Äôs going to be more difficult to increase it later right?  Won‚Äôt Amazon lower my rank?"
2023-12-15,"Good job is for the good reviews that you've got.

Here is my opinions:

Discounts are great to advertise and market leading up to the holiday events. Also, when people leave their cart with items, but don't complete their checkout a lot more sites are sending emails with discounts to help the buyer finish checking out. Also, If you are to do discounts, it's good to announce it in social campaign and email campaign.

Spending money on PPC is worth it if you have good A/B testing system and data to learn from.

Finish A+ Content, this is the cheapest return. If you wisely choose your content you can really save a lot of money that would otherwise go into PPC.

If you send more inventory to Amazon you would want to do a cost analysis; there should be a sweet spot for how much and at what price you will get satisfactory return.

Fundamental opinion, is to focus on branding and customers. Branding is making sure your logo/name is on products and when people see your brand they know and like what it stands for. Focusing on customers means learning from them and knowing what they value and appreciate. That way they can refer your product without you having to spend money."
2023-12-15,"Nope never listed on amazon, just been in ecommerce a long time. only one opinion.

If you've got your PPC listed against your competitors with the the high price, and your product is better, you should be getting a minimum of 6 or 7 sales a day (200 a month - as you mentioned)

You could keep your price as it is, keep running PPC, watch the reviews come in, watch the rankings (amazon adjusts ranking hourly) and see what happens. 3 weeks is not long to say if it's working or not.

Or you could lower the price to what you can afford and still be profitable - and see what happens. Yep if you do this, do it after more Vine reviews have come in.

If it was me I'd wait 3 weeks, and see how the ranking changes. watch the reviews come in. If you dont get up to 6 a day by then, lower the price

yes US can list on temu, but temu is all about being extremely cheap."
2023-12-22,It‚Äôs not particularly skilled labor. If everyone at Amazon quit right now they could replace them pretty quickly.
2023-12-23,"Amazon is roughly 45% of all US ecommerce sales. So for most brands the answer is Amazon. 

Etsy and eBay are smaller fractions of the overall market but larger than most branded domains (ie, Shopify). 

I'd focus on your marketing and sales advantages to determine if you should be focused in selling in any one of them."
2023-12-27,I see that some Google PMs have jumped ship to Amazon for a pay bump and start ruining another product
2023-12-26,"Just got the email, really sad because I do enjoy some amazon shows, but I think this will end it for me."
2023-12-26,"So other businesses pay Amazon to have ads on their platform, yet they are paid for placing ads which covers the cost of listing them. But now if you don‚Äôt want to see the ads you have to pay to not see it. So it‚Äôs consumer vs business money and they are the middle man as usual so they continue to profit both ways.

Now if we cancel memberships they lose money. Theres a big ocean out there, and you don‚Äôt even need a boat."
2023-12-27,"I worked for an Amazon DSP for 3 years and it was both too physically and mentally draining for such little pay and no benefits. I now work for a unionized transit company in my area as a bus driver with a generous pension plan, good benefits, and plenty of overtime available. I‚Äôm currently at step 2 ($33 an hour) and will be at step 5 in 3 years which is $47 an hour. 

The point being - don‚Äôt settle for less and go union!"
2023-12-27,There‚Äôs a union warehouse just down the road from Amazon and they get paid the same as me.
2023-12-27,"You can call me a sheep, my Amazon health insurance has paid out over $978,000 in the last year for me. And I take advantage of other opportunities Amazon provides. It‚Äôs not always all about how much money shows up in your check. I used to work a union job. You know who the union helped? The union. Got you out there walking in picket lines in the heat and the cold and the rain while they sit in their office with no loss of wage using you as a tool to leverage a better contract for themselves and then charge you for it‚Ä¶. Yeah I‚Äôm the sheep"
2023-12-28,"Remember when Amazon kept **adding** new benefits to Prime instead of **removing** them?

*Pepperidge Fahms remembers.*"
2023-12-28,"‚Äú‚Ä¶and the only way to avoid them is pay more.‚Äù   Uh, no.  Later, Amazon."

2023-12-29,You‚Äôre the realest for putting this thread out there. Thanks for doing your job to the best of your ability but also enticing us with your juicy knowledge of the world (of Amazon)
2024-01-03,"Just an idiot Aussie here who's new to being an Amazon seller. So, take it how you will OP. I'm just trying to look at your product as a buyer's eye, and I think you have the price issue too. Your competition prices range from $110 - 150 on average, and you are trying to sell it for $59. I wouldn't go for a product at that price range. I think being that cheap is also repellent for the customers. Another point is; as another commenter said, your hero image and other product photos really look photoshopped, till we see other people in the other photos. This, combined with the cheap price gives me scam vibes. I think you need to look at those points as well. I am very sorry to say this but I think you need brutal honesty. That's the best help I can give."
2024-01-04,You have your website on your detail page. Once Amazon figures it out your listing will be removed. Completely against TOS.
2024-01-05,"God I wanted to post this exact thing.  I‚Äôve been running a website based business for 10 years with average yearly revenue of $10 million.  We noticed a decline in sales starting in June this year and I finally decided to start selling on Amazon and down the rabbit hole I went.  I experience the exact same things. It took months to even start getting noticed there, then things took off and same thing. We sell 10 SKU‚Äôs and only 3 are prime the rest are FBM and we use FedEx and UPS for 90% of the shipments and using the same courier mix on our website sales only maybe 2-3 out of 2,000 weekly shipments get delivered and the customer says they didn‚Äôt receive it.  With Amazon we ship maybe 500 boxes a week and at least 20 a week say they didn‚Äôt get it and then they want a refund instead.  This never happens from our website.  We lose money on FedEx being late.  Weather delay? Customer gets a refund.  Constant used returns that are unsellable.  We get other vendors items as returns all the time.  Not once have I recovered a cent.  Amazon is current holding $55,000 in reserve money for no reason and I have a health rating of 440.  Yet I have to keep selling bc that‚Äôs where people go and to make up the slower web sales this last 6 months Amazon has made it up but at a fraction of the profit. I am non stop on emails bc god forbid I have a day off.  ‚ÄúOver Fucking SLA‚Äù every Sunday."
2024-01-05,"Make sure you‚Äôre purchasing postage through Amazon. 
Never refund a customer if they claim they didn‚Äôt receive it. Instruct them to file an a-to-z claim via live chat. 
Amazon will refund them but not deduct it from you. Nor will it effect your ODR 

But yes. Much of what you said is sadly true. 
It‚Äôs incredibly difficult to sell on Amazon when it‚Äôs set up for sellers to get screwed."
2024-01-04,"Yes, fuck Amazon for their BS, but don't lie to yourself. You'll continue to sell on there like I do. We sell around 80 to 100k a month on Amazon."
2024-01-05,"Most of my sales are not on Amazon,  and I'm thankful for that.  Amazon used to be more profitable for me than our wholesale channel, but as the years have gone by, the margin has been steadily shrinking. I think this will be the first year where profits will be on par, and it looks like the new 2024 fees will dip us below out other channels in profitability.  Needless to say, I put my efforts towards where I can get the most bang for my buck. I have no qualms dropping Amazon completely. If they don't make some real changes, I would imagine most sane sellers will vacate, which will cause customers to vacate too."
2024-01-05,"This months Amazon fuckery:
1) UPS delayed an overnight package due to ‚Äúweather‚Äù - this cause Amazon to suspend all my premium shipping options on my FBM listings. (Was finally resolved after 7 emails back n forth and week of wasted time)

2) Amazon threatening to remove my best selling FBA item because two buyers in a row reported they received ‚ÄúLaser Pointers‚Äù - I dont sell or own laser pointers and everything I send to Amazon I pack and QC check myself. They refuse to accept that they either picked the wrong item or some buyers return was not checked when it arrived. I, apparently, now owe them an essay on how Ill ensure (I) dont mess up again‚Ä¶(two weeks n counting)

3) Amazon threatening to close all my FBM listings because ONE person said there package didnt arrive. They agreed on the replacement I offered for free. Sent that and then they contacted Amazon who promptly refunded them. They then left negative feedback on my seller reviews. So all in all, the customer got two items, a refund, and almost got me expelled from FBM‚Ä¶."

2024-01-06,"Counter-argument. If Amazon is going to spend more on employee expenses, then they should just pay us more. I can feed myself, thanks."
2024-01-08,Amazon MCF operates in UK.I would check with them first.
2024-01-08,"I just left Amazon 2 months ago and it seems pretty true. The return to office feels like they are requiring whatever is most painful from the employee. I don‚Äôt mind being back in office but I just wanted to switch offices, I was denied multiple times with some bs about not enough people on my team there. Funny thing about that was just before I tried to go there they were requiring another guy on my team to move to that SAME office location even though his wife and kids were in the city/office he was hired in. There‚Äôs endless stories of them just making people do the opposite of what they want"

2024-01-09,Get away from Amazon as soon as possible if you want to grow your business. You can simply setup a Shopify site and plug in FBA fullfillment on the back end to keep using Amazon fullfillment until you find a cheaper 3PL. You want to own your customer info for reselling and upselling. You won‚Äôt be able to create any kind of customer life value selling thru Amazon not to mention they can end you at any point without notice.
2024-01-09,"We use MCF because it's easier to have most of the inventory in one place. In terms of pricing....it depends. If we factor in the labor and packaging materials MCF is cheaper for small orders (up to 3-4 items), but if it's a bigger order let say 10-12 items it can be pretty expensive because they charge per item.
Also keep in mind a lot of ppl don't like Amazon and they might not be happy to see the AMZ truck delivering the order they've placed on your website(excluding Amazon logistics is an option though)."
2024-01-09,"You‚Äôll never own your customer sticking only with amazon, as you said, which limits your marketing and branding and likely margins.

2024-01-10,"I wonder if this is an early move to merge Twitch with prime video. 

I could definitely see an executive pushing for this idea based on the the massive rise in popularity of free ad-supported television and digital native content on all platforms‚Äîthe longer they wait the more those two platforms will start to cannibalize each other. 

And if YouTube can have it all in one platform, Amazon is definitely thinking about it."

2024-01-21,"No-one needs to buy from Amazon.  
Instead use Amazon as a product search engine and when you find the product you want, contact the vendor directly.

2024-01-21,"I have a shop of almost 10,000 products. Probably only half are available on Amazon and, of those, most of them are cheaper with us than Amazon. We aren't a value retailer by any stretch, I think Amazon has just overplayed the assumption that it's the cheapest with so many people at this point they are looking for alternatives. There is still plenty of room for high touch retailers that value building a community and real relationships first. We only need a few thousand super loyal customers to really make our business work. When you aren't competing for EVERYONE it's not that hard to find your niche and cater to them. 

That all being said, we don't drop ship."

Google just sits on their high horse and says if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it. We would get a big acquisition or spin off of YouTube before we ever get a dividend from Google."
2024-02-02,Clearly I love dividends if I‚Äôm here. But to wish for companies to like google and Amazon to follow in distrusting dividends makes no sense to me. Why would you want Amazon to give dividends and to stop growing at the scale they are already?
2024-02-02,"Amazon's a great company, with a strong moat around the cloud business in particular.

Its core ecommerce moat is still extensive, though might come under pressure within 5 years - the competition in this space will likely heat up significantly.

2024-02-05,"Amazon approached my small business once about this via email. No money exchanges hands. They think the shopkeeper should do this for the exposure that a troop of Amazon customers will bring to them.

The dealbreaker for me was that we would have no dedicated account rep to solve problems if needed. And I didn‚Äôt want angry Amazon customers in my store, taking off my customers and driving them away. We don‚Äôt need the stress. 

I have another company‚Äôs station in our store that we operate on their behalf and they DO pay us for every one of their customers that comes in.

2024-02-05,"I would probably avoid being in business with Amazon anyway, aside from the helpful information people are providing here that they don‚Äôt actually pay you, Amazon tends to find a way to work around partners and simply bypass them at some point or other. So if it did pay, they would at some point find a shortcut and push you out."
2024-02-05,There's no money to be made. You just sign up for a spot and Amazon determines if your business would be a good place to have a locker.

2024-02-05,Amazon doesn't pay they believe their compensation is the additional foot traffic they give you.  Pretty genius model. For example with Khol's when you return with Amazon they give you a receipt that includes a 15% discount to the store incentivizing you to buy.

Many years back when there were still a lot of open mail relays that would accept connections from anybody, the company I worked for had kind of a nice generic name, and some dickhead decided to send out spam and use our domain.  Open relays did not care so the spam flowed freely and every AM I would get literally hundreds of pieces of hate mail, some threatening, from people being spammed.  For a while I sent out a canned replay that it was not us sending the spam out.  We wound up getting a lawyer and he got a bunch of agencies involved and in the end the caught the guy, using an AOL dial up account that belonged to one of his relatives.  I don't think we ever got any kind of compensation out of it, and I think he got off pretty scott free too.  It just sucks the way the system works most of the time."

2024-02-20,"Hi buddy,

Amazon is hectic. You should watch some youtube videos about it. Is this your own brand, or are you a dropshipper? Wholesaler of another brand.. can you elaborate..

Also, watch out for amazon fees of 7-14% - if you're doing FBA, other charges, etc..

But that's great that you're selling 2-5 per day üëç"
2024-02-20,"Selling on Amazon is a slippery slope. They charge a good chunk off the top with every sale. If you let them warehouse, the fees can add up as they also charge for storage. Plus there is ad spend so people see your offer.  


However, people love prime (fba) and free shipping. So you're trading profit for velocity of sales. The issue is that an unknown brand without reviews won't get many sales, plus your listing needs to be optimized with images and the proper use of bullet points with keywords etc..  


If you ship Amazon orders yourself (fbm), the fees are less (you're paying for shipping so that needs to be calculated into the overall cost). But, your sales will be far less than if you were selling via FBA.  


At this point, you're probably better off not testing the waters on Amazon until you create momentum."

2024-02-20,"I‚Äôm in a similar place but a little bit more sales daily. Right now I‚Äôm only on Shopify where I‚Äôve built an email list, community and regular sales. The advice I was given by some of the top guys is to consider Amazon because there‚Äôs always spillover from your fb ads and other channels. For instance, after someone sees your fb ads, they search google or Amazon to purchase. I‚Äôve noticed it for my brand name on both channels. 

One way to tell if you have any searches on Amazon is to type in your brand name and if it auto populates, you may have some searches. 

I haven‚Äôt leaned into Amazon yet and I used to do FBA as well. I agree with the rest here with high fees but if I can generate extra revenue without too much focus on Amazon and just spill over, I‚Äôd be happy with that. Just some food for thought

Edit: where you can get in trouble is if you‚Äôre too reliant on Amazon and don‚Äôt have any of your own sales from your website. Then you don‚Äôt own customer data to get repeat sales"

Another example - Straws for drinking. Saturated - ton's of sellers. Straws for drinking shaped like men's private parts - yup... there and selling. Not as many suppliers though.

Look at the markets you think you want to be in and then ask - how can I make this unique, at a price point where I can make a profit, and where can I but them from so I can resell on Amazon.

Final one - dog leashes that are printed to say ""My name is come back here stupid!"""

Example: The unit cost of one of my products (raw materials, product packaging, product label) is $1.64. The cost of getting it on Amazon via FBA is approx $7.13 (FBA product packaging requirements, est. shipping to amazon warehouse (shipping box, shipping tape, padding material), Amazon seller/referral fee, Amazon shipping fee.) That's doesn't include any prorated amt for the monthly FBA fee, labor, fuel, etc. And as outrageous as that is, my total cost would be more if I shipped it myself."

*The citation also mentions a van, but it wasn‚Äôt large enough to fit everyone working on loading and unloading aircraft.*

*According to the Warehouse Workers Resource Center, ramp worker Regina Herrmann explained:*

*‚ÄúWe saw that Amazon was more concerned with loading and unloading the planes as fast as possible than with our safety. We work out on the tarmac without enough shade and sometimes without enough water.*

*‚ÄúLast summer was scary. It got so hot and we did not always have enough water to drink or time to let our bodies cool down. We sometimes had to crouch or stand under the planes for shade.‚Äù*"

2024-03-04,"Interesting write up. On one hand, I agree with you that the changes you are describing are good for short term profitability. On the other hand, turning their entire company into a flea market does not seem accretive to long term shareholder value. If I want knock-offs  or relabeled aliexpress stuff, I can just go direct to that platform. 

I worked for a company that sold to Amazon, and the experience of having to deal with all of the counterfeit and grey market items in their marketplace dissuaded me from ever buying from any 3rd party seller there. And since Amazon has made it harder to filter by seller, I've largely stopped buying from them at all. 

That said, I know a ton of people who have Amazon packages delivered multiple times per day. Should probably consider adding to my position, too, lol."
2024-03-04,"Solid logic, also why Amazon has a strong chart, reliable growth and ridiculous p/e. You buy Amazon at any price and just hold it."
2024-03-04,"Don't take this personally, but you (by which I mean 'third party sellers') is why we went from spending high six figures per year through Amazon to zero.  Maybe not you specifically, but many third party merchants range from terrible to crooked.  Amazon became a crapshoot of what product or service you would get.  

Early on we could steer and filter to Amazon-fulfillment only, but they became so integrated with crummy third party sellers that it was impossible to stay clear.  And third party sellers were also infesting Amazon fulfillment, with returns and counterfeit items migrating from the third party side into the Amazon side.  

For perspective, we had direct access to people second to Bezos.  But seeing how Amazon was not only doing little to curb the problem but instead was enabling and expanding them, we went cold turkey.  

So in a sense, we'd agree.  Amazon's rapacious conduct and philosophy is not something I want to do business with, but is something I expected to show up as EPS, and thus grew the equity position.  

At times I've questioned if Amazon's 180 into anti-customer anti-partner anti-everybody practices would sabotage their growth.  But it seems like they've been able to ride that out with some assistance from the pandemic.  

Amazon used to delight customers.  Now, customers just seem to tolerate them.  And most customers don't even know what you do, which is that most of the customer-aligned practices like returns or refunds are fully funded by the vendors and suppliers they strongarm, not by Amazon's generosity.

I too have used awareness of a company's bad practices as a thesis for holding the equity.  The bitterness of Apple's terrible policies and corrupt practices was moderated by knowing I could pay for the warranties they wouldn't honor by using stock gains.

I've said we'll go back to Amazon they day they end third party, but it doesn't seem like that's happening anytime soon."

Also, Amazon has its own search algorithm and Amazon results rank highly in google shopping. If your agency is doing SEO work for you then it's probably contributing. 

Lastly, from my experience, certain customers are more comfortable with buying through Amazon instead of direct through a 3rd party store because Amazon will facilitate any disputes or chargebacks pretty much no questions asked.

I decided not to open an Amazon store for 2 reasons: Amazon is expensive, and having an Amazon store makes it so your Shopify store has to compete with it directly so you're competing with yourself. If the prices are the same, some customers will opt for the more trustworthy channel."

2024-03-08,"It's likely that your Meta ads are influencing Amazon sales. Consumers often research products they see in ads on other platforms, like Amazon, to read reviews or seek better deals. To understand this behavior, consider using unique promo codes or tracking URLs in your ads to gauge direct impact. Additionally, survey customers on Amazon about how they found your product. For future strategy, optimize your Amazon listing, consider Amazon ads, and perhaps run ads targeting Amazon directly. Balancing both platforms while understanding cross-channel influence will be key to maximizing your overall ecommerce strategy."

As pointed out, their buyer-above-all refund policies are terrible.  We don't do FBA, but Amazon still makes arbitrary decisions on refunds that run counter to the refund/return policies THEY make us post.  What sense does it make for Amazon to require us to post our own return/refund policies just to have them ignore them?

And recently Amazon has been trying to enforce same-day shipping on us.  They is OUR policy, not theirs.  And don't even get me started on Amazon Prime...  


Like I said... I hate Amazon.  They have been the worse thing for sellers and they teach buyers that it's OK to abuse seller refund/return policies."
2024-03-11,"This could be a long post, I'll try to shorten it as much as I can.  


I was a very early FBA user.  


Continual increase in fee's was a big one. The cost of sending boxes of inventory was cheap, but a return of products was expensive so that was kind of sketchy; but they want to be able to ""destroy"" the items which was a nice way of saying they want to resell them.  


On very competitive ASIN's, I would be selling hundreds of something per day, have a bunch left in stock and then all of a sudden sales would stop. Then my inventory would go from 200 to 110, and then I was being reimbursed for 5% of the sales price of the item; less than I was buying it for, and they would show up sale instantly by Amazon WarehouseDeals or whatever it was; so I would buy them, and they were completely fine but if I didn't catch it then I would simply lose all of that money.   


One day I had been selling and shipping in full force; sending in LTL's and full truckloads, just really fucking going hard on this. I call my accountant to review some of last quarters earnings and right there in a pie chart was how much Amazon was making and how much I wasn't making. I just couldn't shake that feeling; selling something and just making pennies at the end of the day."
2024-03-11,"I quit selling on Amazon nearly two years ago now. Never looked back. I was mostly a media seller, so on top of all the charges, they also docked you automatically for $1 on each item. Also, the Amazon site inventory and data is so screwed up now, I don't think it will ever be repaired. I had several items change underneath me after I listed an item. It's pointless."
2024-03-11,Amazon FBA is convenient but the returns can be ridiculous and Amazon's ability to bleed money every which way from my pocket is what made me leave. I found the fulfillment to be high quality but overall FBA/referral fees to be overpriced. The seller support is insufferable - basically a glorified chatbot. I've heard of people having their accounts deactivated just like you and Amazon basically holding their inventory hostage without explanation. I trust them wholeheartedly as a customer but not as a seller.
2024-03-11,"Although i understand your reasons, Id suggest instead of simply dropping it signing an exclusive agreement with a reseller. Offer someone to buy from your and sell your brand on Amazon (through their account) with deferred payment terms or whatever (or even just a wholesale model with amazon exclusivity)

They know there is stable demand and potential and you make money without having to deal directly with Amazon. Works globally btw. If you find a good partner this can grow significantly and offer some income to you with very minimal headaches"
2024-03-12,Amazon is actual dogshit. I‚Äôve never seen a less intuitive back end of a website and it‚Äôs a fucking multi trillion dollar company. Actual garbage and they take way too much from sellers. Run your own website. Why wouldn‚Äôt you?

2024-03-13,"I'm really confused how you can be on Walmart and Amazon but not think eBay is with the hassle? What is the hassle exactly? There's really affordable software to export your listings from any marketplace and import them to another. In 1 day you can have all of your products listed, and then you just need to sync your orders to the same place the Walmart and Amazon ones are going for fulfillment."
2024-03-13,"In my experience the selling limits are pretty generous in terms of the number of items you can list. I don't think 6k SKUs would run into a problem. The only problem I run into with the selling limits is they cap the dollar amount you can have posted at 1 time. I had a $1million limit that was hard to stay under unless I kept my stock quantities very low, but thankfully they removed that last month so now I have no restrictions.


If you can get your listings exported and then imported into eBay nicely, I would say it's worth your time. eBay doesn't get as much traffic as Amazon or Walmart, but their fees are much lower and they have fewer restrictions so it is one of my personal favorite marketplaces."
2024-03-14,">Also Ebay only allowed X amount of listings live at one time, so that was another issue.
>
> We have 6k SKU's. 

We have over 50,000 SKU's and eBay doesn't even blink. As long as you have been assigned appropriate limits to your account (e.g. number and dollar value of items listed) it should work for you.

As a new seller you would need to work up slowly as they expand your limits over time. You may be able to get CS to raise a request for an early increase if you can point to a good history and similar # of SKU's on Amazon.

BTW be aware that they count dollar value not just by the selling price of each BIN listing but also the quantity you advise as available. So if you tell them you have 100 of a $10 item they will count it as $1000 against your selling limit. For new sellers it can be useful to tell eBay a lower inventory count than you might actually have on your shelf so as to reduce that total as it cuts into your ability to list other SKU's.

We sell on both Amazon and eBay (and formerly on Walmart, but that was such a bad experience we turned it off) and while eBay sales are lower they are *way* less of a headache to deal with than Amazon."
2024-03-17,"Does anyone have any old documentation that shows exactly which services FBA covers?

Inventory doesn't sell: fee
Customer wants to return an item for ANY REASON within 30 days: fee + return postage + disposal fee

Amazon is making money at every step and bleeding 3rd party sellers dry.

Amazon needs to cut the bullshit and start charging fickle customers for their returns."
2024-03-17,"This is after a certain threshold and it makes sense. Poorly executed, because Amazon leadership is just trash, but it does make sense.  Their return expense is ballooning, but there are two main culprits, not the whole 3P seller system. The first is the pretty much unchecked ability for Chinese sellers to open and supply FBA accounts with low quality trash, only to be eventually suspended And reopen accounts a week later. Another major issue is the indiscriminate returns by crybaby prime customers. I'm a prime customer too and it's way too easy to return something.  This is a huge selling point for the prime service but they should selectively target non profitable return abusers (they already are,  just not nearly aggressively enough ). 
What the trash leadership doesn't get is that combining unreasonable disposal and return fees, along with higher fulfillment fees, will pretty much eliminate any low margin product in the platform. Great thing to do when everyone is flush with cash. Dumb thing to do when temu is right up your ass in sales revenue. And as usual,  they'll change their approach once it bites them in the ass, but it will be too late by then.  
On the bright side, this is a test for sellers. Adapt and grow, and have less low end competition,  or give up."
2024-03-18,"Amazon basically is AliExpress at this point. They‚Äôre making these rules because of all the Chinese flush with factory money dumping inventory into Amazon with absolutely zero marketing killing the little guy.

2024-03-19,"Yeah I felt similar my first year. Don't worry, with enough time, you'll become jaded enough to not care. 

I'm only half joking, really. People can be real shitty. I deal with probably 10-20 people every single week that are unreasonable, uncivilized, and downright nasty. It's part of doing business, especially in e-commerce, and even more especially when you're selling on a platform that fosters and rewards this behavior in order to boost their brand at the expense of their partners. 

The thing is, regardless of what issues I have with Amazon, customers, fees, other sellers, etc.. my business continues to grow. Selling on Amazon, like anything else, requires us to adapt to change. As long as you keep adapting, learning, and applying what you've learned; you can be successful. It's a business, and business is almost always hard. If it's not hard, you're not doing it right."

2024-03-23,"Are they having you ship the orders directly to Amazon or a 3PL company? I screen the wholesale applications for a B2B company and we get so many people that are in Asia applying for accounts that want to ship our products directly to Amazon. They will call us and claim they are in the USA, but in reality they use ""virtual addresses"" to register their businesses. I track their IPs when they apply for a wholesale account - they are all actually in Asia. I deny them all because they don't give us a physical business address so we would probably have no recourse if they scammed us on a payment."
2024-03-24,"ask for their website, don't let them sell on amazon. start small, if anything go wrong, you can cut them off."
2024-03-23,"I have not seen any other listings than the one I own. Our Amazon rep said customers will buy on OUR Amazon listing, but a 3rd party reseller will actually get the sale, revenue, and fulfillment. I'm confused & shocked this happens without the actual brand's (my) consent.

Replacing our label with theirs would be silly. Just go source this product and make it yourself for $3 instead of buying mine for $25 to slap a label onto."
2024-03-24,Depends on what you sell but Walmart and Target Plus are the two to look at after Amazon and eBay I would say.
2024-03-24,"If you are a Walmart Marketplace seller, you need to have certain degree of control over your shipping carrier. Walmart counts orders as a valid shipment after the ""origin scan"" (when the package starting moving within the carrier's network). This means if Fedex picks up a truck worth of orders today and forget to put in an origin scan until tomorrow, you will take a hit on your VTR (valid tracking rate), which is a KPI you do not want to mess up. This is especially problematic since even if you do ""ship"" on or before the required ship date, you will only meet the on time shipment metric, not the VTR metric. When USPS gets busy, they will cause a lot of VTR problem by no having that origin scan.

I believe this is done to heavily incentivize using Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS, their version of FBA). What Walmart and WFS are doing though, is targeting all the pain points of FBA in an attempt to steal business and grow: reduced or no surge pricing for storage, lower fulfillment fees, better rates for sellers buying shipping through Walmart, etc.

For listings, when Walmart finds your listing uncompetitive they will unpublish your listing or let the best seller for that SKU (Walmart determines whether multiple SKU are identical products across sellers) take over entirely. Walmart doesn't seem to want 200 different variations of the same product polluting the search results, so they are doing some product curation.

When I still sold on Walmart last year, it was much easier and cheaper to get front page ranking, like 5-10x less spend on ads vs Amazon. However, the volume just doesn't compare.

As far as the customer base, it's surprisingly not bad. Returns and claims are in line with other marketplaces."
2024-03-27,I know this is coming way from left field but it‚Äôs good to see Amazon is willing to open the pocket book. I say this as a shareholder and fan of Rivian who may need some capital injected to reach its full potential. Given that Amazon already has 10K delivery vans from Rivian it wouldn‚Äôt be good form them to have to maintenance them with other support of a health OEM.

2024-03-28,"I started on VC and switched around 100k in sales. Ended with around 10MM FBA route by the time I sold. 

Amazon won't say this outright but all the talent got moved from VC to SC a long time ago. That's why there's little new feature set on VC and all the exclusives from before (Vine, promos, ads) are now cross platform.

There's pretty much zero reason to use VC, but you realize this. If you are able, just list against all your VC listings via FBA and transition out that way. Most FBA guys will just assume it's possible, but if you have really antiquated ASINs, they can be really messed up in the catalog and require a butt load of work. Or your inventory immediately gets pulled with an IP violation and you can't prove ownership of the brand even though you are BR owner. 

I helped one company switch and to be perfectly honest only 70% of ASINs successfully made the jump. Super frustrating because they did all the right things with having BR, an AM and contribute rights but there is still some crazy ass privilege that some 1P/VC listings have that screw up the ability for the BR to contribute updates.

Just be persistent with SS and escalate issues straight to the catalog team if you can. Better luck with phone vs email. We used a bunch of tricks that no longer work now but hopefully the gremlins we ran into are fixed for you.

Like I said, sounds like it should be incredibly straight forward, and for most of your ASINs it will, but cross your fingers on the rest. Good luck."
2024-03-28,I have a 2.5MM Amazon business and I don‚Äôt know what VC means.
2024-03-27,"I went through this - the downsides of VC started to increasingly grow frustrating.  Amazon's inflexibility in the face of inflationary pressure made what is supposed to feel like a great experience (i.e. commerce on a large scale) feel foreboding and filled with anxiety.  

Here's how we approached it - we co-listed all the ASINs on FBA and focused on multi-packs as a key differentiator (adding volume discounts) to help build our sales ranking while sending in inventory and slowing down our VC refills.  We didn't have much of a track record with the VC side (as we went from FBA to VC and then back).

One thing which was extremely frustrating was the fact that all the VC ASINs are locked behind catalog edits guarded by Amazon's Catalog team.  Getting edits or updates on even the smallest details takes a lot of time, patience, and can be frustrating. Thankfully, I didn't onboard my entire portfolio.

Amazon is greedy AF so get ready for a lot of frustrating BS.  We have since also co-listed as FBM alongside FBA and so far it's working."
2024-03-27,"Well then, good for FUCKIN‚Äô Amazon stockholders; they certainly need *our* help."
2024-03-28," Ehhhh, I think you should use Amazon to either get on your feet till you figure out wtf you want to do with your life, or you‚Äôre going to school and need the cash.

I personally wouldn‚Äôt waste my time trying to move up at Amazon, honestly it‚Äôs probably faster to get a degree and start at management level."
2024-03-28,"I'm sorry about your experience, but tbh Amazon has tons of benefits that just keep me here. I've never had a job where I can just not ""show up"" as long as I have the time to cover it. Also not having to ask any AM to go home early, if I have the time, I'm gone. VTO hits my phone? I'm taking it. I literally was able to take a week off just off VTO because my site is slow atm which I've never been able to do at another job. Also this is coming from a 4yr fellow associate, but I've had a PLETHRA of jobs and nothing comes close to the benefits and time off options you get here. 

I do know some sites are trash, but once you get to a site that actually has competent management that goes all the way up to the site lead, its honestly not that bad. I do hope you take advantage of their College benefits even if its not a degree the fact that education is being paid for is priceless, imo. 


Good luck to you! üíØ"

2024-04-04,"> But instead of closing the technological loop with pure automation and AI, the company also had to rely on an army of over 1,000 workers in India, who were acting as remote cashiers.

This quote doesn't match the other stories that I've read about this Amazon project. The 1000 contractors were reviewing video of edge case transactions to see if ""just walk out"" got it wrong, but they weren't real time cashiers. I'm not defending this project. I didn't like it when it came out and I'm glad it is dead. But I don't trust ""The Byte"" slant on this either."
2024-04-04,"I think Amazon Fresh is not gonna be around too much longer. It‚Äôs pretty much a generic grocery store. Average prices, no special/unique offerings, and of average size for a grocery store.

It‚Äôs fine, but there‚Äôs no differentiator. Also the Amazon association is not great in this space. It‚Äôs confusing to old people, like my retired parents who are not prime members. They went to the previous grocery store occupying the space, because they liked the meat selection but afaik, they have never went to Amazon Fresh"
2024-04-04,"I went to Amazon Fresh extensively for the convenience of this service. It made errors particularly when I put an item back and picked it up again. It often didn't notice that I picked it up again. 

IMO, a simple hack to easily make the system more accurate is to simply put a scale in the cart to verify/aid the AI predictions. Weight is already an accurate measure to confirm something in the checkout line.

Ironically, they added a scale to the carts AFTER they ended the JustWalkOut program and repurposed the carts as mobile self-checkout kiosks."

2024-04-03,Earnings call is at the end of the month. Amazon is just doing their usual tricks to look good to their investors.
2024-04-03,">Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across almost every area of the company.¬†

Ok, well, Amazon hired over 400,000 employees during a 9 month period of 2020 alone.  \~33% of its workforce at the time.  These numbers do not include employee churn, nor do they include temporary holiday workers.  NOR do they include delivery drivers, who are contractors and not direct Amazon employees.  Their workforce right now is still 400,000 people MORE than it was in 2021.

With certainty they did not do this with the belief that those were all permanent positions.  And more of them were engineering and software than some of you are probably thinking right now.  But it is impossible to have a reasonable discussion about Amazon on Reddit."
2024-04-03,"Andy Jassy slept through the AI revolution and watched NVIDIA and Microsoft run away. When was the last time Amazon invented something new that got us excited ? At least 5 yrs ago. He is turning into a conventional CEO curting costs, limiting CAPEX to support the stock price short term. These lay offs, not giving L6+ employees 1-2% base compensation inflation adjustment this year are just a sign of a company entering Day 2 that Bezos predicted."
2024-04-05,Long term I chose Amazon. Since I shop there more
2024-04-05,Amazon has invested in long term domination. Their AWS and fulfilment platforms are unmatched. They are slashing headcount and starting to focus on cash flow. Look out
2024-04-05,Why not both? If I had to pick though probably Amazon
2024-04-05,"Amazon has the biggest cloud market share, significant online store that over the years has expanded. They regularly try to expand into new markets. Most recently into healthcare and smart wearables such as glasses. They might not all end up successful but they have put more effort into growth than Apple"
2024-04-05,Amazon because they will take over the world.
2024-04-11,I think alot of successful Amazon sellers won't really tell their story.  I think the most successful Amazon sellers came from a reseller background  whether wholesale or Ebay and leverage that knowledge.
2024-04-11,"For me what worked was building very unique brands, been on Amazon since 2011, Did reselling on eBay since 98. so had experience in copywriting and found some niches that were undeveloped or had big companies pull out from because they weren‚Äôt big enough for them but for a small operation it‚Äôs more than enough. 

I think without a huge budget it would very hard to do the ‚Äúme too‚Äù products now, basically private labeling the same thing as others and be very successful. We definitely have that but they are more complimentary products and our 80/20 is made up of original designs, patented products and unique offerings that still no one has copied. We have a seasonal best seller that makes around $250K every summer been selling it since 2016 and yet we are still the only one like it and it wouldn‚Äôt be terribly difficult to copy. The main reason why nobody has probably copied it? We manufacture it ourselves, it doesn‚Äôt come from China and no factory makes anything remotely close is my guess. 

Building very high quality and becoming obsessive about it to your audience will make it last and give you repeat customers for life.  On Amazon we are doing mid seven figures, but you need to know your numbers and not invest your capital into products that don‚Äôt give you the best ROI unless they compliment your product line but for main product you need to dial that in. Amazon fees are just increasing, just in the last 5 years it has gone from 26% to 38% of our gross sales. 

Find something you can build an audience around, with unique features and market the shit out of that off of Amazon. That‚Äôs what others are too lazy to do and those that do are more successful. Sorry if this is all over the place, it‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm tired. Best of luck"
2024-04-11,"I‚Äôve also been doing Amazon fba for 5 years, launched my first product in late 2019.

I‚Äôve learned different lessons for each one and Im hoping this 5th one will be my big break."
2024-04-11,You do Amazon full time? It‚Äôs very hard it‚Äôs my second year selling and I haven‚Äôt really made profit. Just focusing on launching products
2024-04-11,"As a shareholder, I am deeply concerned that Mr. Jassy is producing a short term gain at the expense of a longterm one. By destroying morale, burning out employees and making it impossible for new ideas to flourish I believe he is doing a disservice to employees, customers and shareholders alike. It is known that acting Jack Welch or Chainsaw Al is bad for business - just look at the fall of GE. I have several close friends who work at Amazon that are high performers and already burnt out‚Ä¶ the average tenure of employees is dropping. Business units like AWS have insane employee turnover.

I want to see longterm strategy and vision return to Amazon‚Ä¶ costcutting like this smacks of, ‚ÄúI have tried nothing and I am all out ideas.‚Äù At this rate, I think Bezos will have to return temporarily to right the ship and find a new successor.

Prime is no longer worth it with the increased fee and remove services and now ads in our tv shows‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not the deal we signed up for.

On the other hand, Amazon is so big that likely the stock will grow some regardless of what the CEO does."
2024-04-11,He is a massive step down after Bezos. Got lucky with how steong a fundamentals Amazon had and still slept through AI revolution because he was busy layingoff and cutting annual compensation. Just plain awful. He should send a thank you letter to Sundar as he takes the bottom of the barrel spot instead of Andy
2024-04-11,"Can confirm. Work at Amazon got HV3 for the past year and got a 2% bump in base salary, no additional RSU, no cash bonus. The ""raise"" I got is from stock appreciation. Guess I'll just eat shit if market crashes then. Fuck this company."
2024-04-11,"I‚Äôm a large mid 8 figure Amazon seller and we get some decent size business orders and it seems to be growing more and more and we only sell food so our bulk discounts are minimal . 

It‚Äôs definitely being used and growing"
2024-04-13,"I think there are several ways to address your question, but I will do so from my own early experiences selling on FBA.  First of all you have to accept the fact that the Amazon platform is a for-profit business.  On top of this, they have no competition for the FBA platform thus far and they set the rules, own the field, the refs, the ball, and the league.  If you don't like it, go play somewhere else.  Sucks, but if you think Amazon owes you something just because you have products to sell, it is the incorrect approach.  

The platform is ""buyer-centric"" not ""seller centric"".  They have a monster captive audience of buyers which is why as a seller, you want to access those buyers.   Besides this, Amazon themselves are the actual sellers on many products and are selling more products themselves every day.  It is hard to compete with them.

The obvious sign that it is harder to be a seller is that i they really wanted to grow their seller base, then Seller Support would not be as horrible as it is today.  Progressively it has gotten worse over the years.  There is a reason for this.

So then, to address your question, you need to be super smart about what you sell.  Think small and valuable, like a diamond.  The smaller the item and higher the price, the less in fulfillment fees and storage fees you will get charged.  Whereas larger, bulky, heavy items will crush you in fees.  

Even then I sometimes looked at a 25% -33% rule of thumb where if I paid $10 for something and could send a pallet with say 400 items, then I was happy getting $12.50 back after all fees.  So a 25% return.  Usually these items would sell for $25 to $30.  My thinking at the time was I could move 400 items in one shot, never see them again and not deal with making 400 little packages every time something sold.  

FBA is something great if you can find the right mix of product and profit.  But it can also be frustrating.  If you find yourself not making enough and complaining about it, then you need to rethink your strategy.

Hope this helps.,"

My biggest takeaway was, Amazon charge a lot of fees.  I‚Äôm talking around 40%. There are a lot of product listing rules to adhere to, and to get to the top you need to pay a lot in advertising costs. You also need to get reviews to even come up on search pages. I remember I didn‚Äôt run a campaign for a while, and I was still getting charged. Even called up customer service and they weren‚Äôt very helpful.

It's not pleasant but when they have a de facto monopoly on online sales there's not much you can do."
2024-04-30,I sold on Amazon FBM for a few years and did decent enough.  It seemed to me that over the years with all of the changes put in place that they are trying to push out the little sellers and cater to the big brands and foreign sellers (non-US).

I earn about $5 profit on each one (after accounting for the product, all fees, and shipping, not advertising. I have a $15 daily budget for advertising), but after my advertising I realized I'm paying about 40 cents per product I sell.  I now have a 3.9 star rating which is stressful.  I just ordered a completely unrelated product and should be receiving it in about a month, then labeling and shipping into Amazon for FBA.

I'm assuming it is FBA, so you can easily order, and return for full refund. Do this, claim it is fake in the return process. There is a chance that just saying the word 'fake' in the return process will give them a violation in the account. Amazon is run by bots....

Either way, yeah, if they ever come back on, make the order, return/ refund, claim copyright. Its not 100% guaranteed to work, but its the best solution I've found."
2024-05-24,Never have had to advertise for an Amazon listing. How does your product compare to the same product on Amazon?
2024-05-24,Most of your ad budget for Amazon should be via Amazon's own ad platform.
2024-05-28,"I tell my family not to buy large or expensive items from Amazon for exactly this reason, especially electronics. A game controller? Okay, but not TVs or phones. Instead buy from a business that has a brick and mortar store nearby with a real returns counter manned be real people, like Best Buy or the Apple Store. That way, the return goes smoothly with no chance of being accused of garbage like returning an empty box or a box full of dirt, or of not using the right QR code."
2024-05-28,"Booo! Paywall!

I don‚Äôt know what the author‚Äôs problem is since I can only see a small portion of the article but I‚Äôve never had a problem with returns. Start the return in the app, take the item to UPS and hand it to them while showing the code  got from Amazon. I rarely have to even package the item.  
No complaints here."
2024-05-28,I haven't had any problems with returns with Amazon either.
2024-05-28,"I returned a 49‚Äù ultrawide monitor that arrived damaged, the driver noted damage to the box, I have doorbell camera footage with audio, pictures of it and unboxing video, returned it to Amazon and took over a month of fighting and no return. They sent investigation forms and nothing changed, sent in all my pictures and video and still nothing, they said they have 30 days to refund and check back then. 

Finally after a month of fighting for the refund they sent me an new investigation form to fill out claiming without it they can‚Äôt refund, i said I‚Äôve done this 3 times, but I filled it out again with the agent on chat and sent it back, this time within 3 minutes of them saying it was received they issued the refund!!!

How and why did I need to do all this just for them to issue it anyways within a couple minutes."
2024-05-28,"It may just be the things I've ordered, where I live or perhaps just good luck, but I haven't had any issues returning things to Amazon at all. 

I always return to the Kohl's five minutes from my house - they scan everything and wrap it up in the plastic bag for me, and then that's all done. I usually have my refund posted within an hour or two. The only ""tricky"" thing to note is that when returning multiple things, I have to pay attention to which items fall under which QR code, but it's very clearly labeled."
2024-05-28,"The OG author sounds like nothing but whining  child about having to find a bag or box to fit returns in , however, as an Amazon customer since 2005 (likely longer but that was the earliest order I could find), I CAN say that they‚Äôve done some pretty shitty stuff with returns lately 

Up until a couple of years ago, it was nice and convenient for me, a WFH individual (since 2002) who doesn‚Äôt drive to get a return in .  Simply just let them know, they‚Äôd schedule a pick up, or I could print my own label and have it dropped off.  No fees whatsoever 

A couple of years ago, they changed this ..  They started charging $8 for SOME pickups, but not all, and labels were still feee.  Even UPS store drop offs, free.  Still convenient.  I just printed the label and had DoorDash drop them off

Somewhere in the last couple of months (my last DD pickup was March 20), they started charging us to print the labels at home now.  Same amount as UPS pick ups

Next, they‚Äôll be coming after the Kohl‚Äôs returns as well, it‚Äôs only a matter of time

It‚Äôs becoming far less ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù to use Amazon for anything any more"
2024-05-29,"Just remember ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" amazon can suspend your accounts for whatever reason tomorrow and you'll go from earning good money to zero. You only have to read the seller forums to see that this happens everyday.

Even though I haven't done this myself, I'd suggest you grow the FBA business and sell it whilst its at peak (dont hesitate as competitors are constantly entering the market and soon they'll steal your market share). Then use your new found wealth to invest in other things,"
2024-05-29,"Adding my own tips to the list:

4. For my full timers, Career Choice is lowkey goated please look into it. They pay for a bunch of degrees and WGU is fully online, self-paced, and fully payed for. If you go into IT through them like I do they'll also give you hella certs while you get college credit

5. If you enroll in Career Choice or already have one, use that student email for YouTube Premium, Spotify Premium, Hulu, and Amazon Prime discounts they cut the subscription price by almost half 

6. For my Android users don't pay a dime for Spotify or YouTube Premium, look into ReVanced or XManager 

7. Screw going for PA or into Operations in general, you'll be overwork, underappreciated, and shit on by everyone over and under you. Go for a support path instead or do the bare minimum, get that experience/knowledge and dip, don't give this place anything more"
2024-05-30,That's a very logical approach.  I did that when I bought Amazon and others long ago and it's worked out well.   I bought Microsoft in the 90's at $12/share and even on days like this I don't even think about it.
2024-05-31,"I haven't had anything like this happen to me, but my spider-senses tell me it's a scam. If you're EVER in doubt, hang up, and get in touch with the support team they are claiming to be (in this example, contact Amazon). If they don't know what the person who called was talking about, you can bet it's a scam."
2024-05-31,"Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for. Amazon should continue to rip higher as it expands AWS, its advertising, and advancements in AI. Walmart isn‚Äôt investing in AI (or if they are, not nearly as much as Amazon), and is continuing to expand their advertising business (ie buying Vizio). Walmart will be more stable, as I think 50-60% of their revenue comes from grocery sales.

Basically, are you looking to grow your capital aggressively and earn a little income? AMZN. Or are you looking for a solid stock to own that‚Äôs never going to impress but be a solid addition to any portfolio? WMT."
2024-05-31,"Walmart is a safer bet, and appearing to be just as much of a growth play as Amazon these days"
2024-06-01,"Clothes are selling 1. Because you can try them on or at least have a decent idea they will fit, where online it's a gamble and can be annoying to return. 2. Because as you said, they are unique. Is the perfume unique as well?

I would look into unique perfumes that you can't find on Amazon, but keep that inventory low until you pick up momentum. And for things you can find online, I would sell them as cheap as you can where it still makes sense, at least until you can unload the inventory."
2024-06-01,"I sell toys. Amazon does make it tough on lots of products, but people want to be in our space supporting local. Do you offer giftwrap or any other services? Or some kind of bundle discount perhaps or rewards program? How is your customer service and product knowledge? How is the vibe and decor in your store?

You could also think about dropping the price a bit and seeing if it helps. You don't need to meet amazon's price, just try some kind of sale. People literally love sales. Yes you are not making as much profit but if you aren't in a MAP agreement with the vendor you can change prices asyou see fit.   Sometomes moving volume now is better than waiting for max profit later.

Many people who come into a small shop understand they will be paying more than amazon and they will do so if you give them good reason.

Also, a lot of people who walk into a small business don't buy anything regardless.

Your other option is stop carrying the brand. Sometimes its just not worth it to deal with amazon undercutters."
2024-06-04,If you‚Äôre too broke to afford a PO Box. You‚Äôre too broke to be able to afford to start an Amazon business.
2024-06-08,God damn bro do you work at the gay amazon or something
2024-06-16,Walmart gets me my stuff same day and even within hours of ordering.    Amazon can‚Äôt compete with that.
2024-06-16,"I ordered a collectable action figure from Walmart as a gift for someone's birthday, and Walmart stuck a huge inventory label right on the front of the package.  You just don't do that with collectable items or you use labels that come off easily and don't stick like superglue.  The item was essentially made worthless as a collectable.  I reached out to Walmart and their response was basically ""too bad.""

I've also ordered items from Walmart in glass jars (from candles to food items) that always arrived shattered.

Trying to get these issues fixed with Walmart was an utter nightmare.  That's when I gave up ordering from Walmart. 
 At least with Amazon, they quickly either refund me or replace the items without giving me grief."
2024-06-16,"Amazon may have built it but is on the path to losing it due to poor customer service, increased order errors, and lousy delivery drivers."
2024-06-16,"I  use it all the time , works way better than amazon,  I get  $6 items delivered same day for free with plus membership includes free paramount... I even get pool supplies delivered on subscription every Thursday in gallon jugs saves me buying 25 gallons up front..and its the same price as if I went and got it..."
2024-06-16,"I love this service and use as much as Amazon.  It's great for grocery delivery and quick items.  I check there sometimes before Amazon, which never used to happen."
2024-06-16,"Yes, Walmart online in past months has indeed been copying some of Amazon's worst moves of the past several years. Costs and inconveniences of using Walmart Online have skyrocketed, so that I no longer see it as nearly as good a replacement for Amazon Prime as I used to. Now they both suck. :-("
2024-06-21,Temu is cheaper and sells the same stuff. I get certain things from amazon but they wont get me to sub to prime
2024-06-21,"Unpopular opinion: your fears are the goal. Amazon is wildly more profitable with AWS than retail and how often does a data center go on strike? Their compute infrastructure brings a fraction of the revenue, most of the profit, and the racks themselves don‚Äôt need health insurance like warehouse workers.

If this all sounds far-fetched, remember we‚Äôre talking about an online bookseller right now‚Ä¶"
2024-06-20,I think Amazon is doing everything in their power to turn away customer and sellers. The trajectory they are one will lead to dollar store quality items at double the price. There is no value there for anybody.
2024-06-20,5.9 Million for Amazon is like sneezing in a tissue....
2024-06-20,"Good deal for Amazon. Only 100dollars for each ""documented"" labor law violation. Think about all not documented violations. No need to stop"
2024-06-20,"To put it into context:

Amazon's profit in 2023 was around 30 billion.

5.9million of that is 0.02%


If you had let's say around 10,000$ in savings. Amazon's fine would be like paying a 2$ fine."
2024-06-20,So $5.9 million divided by 59000 violations comes to $100 per violation. I‚Äôm gonna guarantee that the only lesson learned is to make sure that the algorithm makes each future violation worth more than $100 to the company. If I commit a violation such as accidentally speeding it‚Äôs multiple hundreds of dollars. If Amazon commits a violation of labor laws(meaning there‚Äôs an actual victim) it‚Äôs $100
2024-06-20,"To Amazon, it's just the cost of making profits.     
There's no incentive to stop."
2024-06-24,"I am EU based seller selling mainly on Amazon USA (and of course also EU+UK). 

What exactly do you want to do? Where is your inventory currently? Where do you want to keep it? How are you currently acquiring your customers and what is the CoA?

Your question is too vague to provide any concrete answers. You can PM if you do not want to say more in public."
2024-06-25,Interesting. In the US Amazon collects and submits the sales tax on sales in all states and jurisdictions on behalf of vendors making the process frictionless. I‚Äôm surprised they‚Äôre not doing the same in Europe
2024-06-24,We‚Äôre a jump rope brand doing ROAS of around 5 on Google ads. Currently our stock is at our own warehouse and we do shipping ourselves. But if I look at Amazon FBA their shipping seems to be about half the costs of our shipping due to local warehousing. Doing Amazon FBA is not a problem for us as we have enough inventory. Also if Amazon FBA works well we‚Äôre ok with moving completely to Amazon FBA with multichannel fulfilment as it would save costs in the end and shipping would be quicker.¬†
2024-06-25,"Amazon can do that for EU countries as well but this costs ‚Ç¨50 per country per month. In our case this would be ‚Ç¨350 per month, which seems like a steep fee. However I‚Äôm not sure if we can just do it via the OSS regulations.¬†"
2024-06-24,"Which country are you based in and where do you want to sell?

In general, selling on Amazon (compared to your own store)

PROS:

* Much higher traffic
* Cheaper shipping rates if you choose FBA
* You can easily integrate FBA into your eCom (at least Shopify, Woo etc.) so you will benefit on your current shop.

CONS:

* Ad-spend can be high if it is a competitive category
* Higher possibilities of scams or dishonest buyers. Amazon will favor buyers most of the time.
* No compensation for returned inventory damaged by customer
* Might have VAT/Sales tax implications based on your legal structure and location

So what exactly do you want to know? What did you mean by ‚Ç¨1000 service costs? Who is quoting this for you? Selling on Amazon is free or you pay 40 EUR a month professional seller fee.

Other than that there are no fixed fees for registration."
2024-06-24,We are located within the EU and want to sell to all countries within the EU. If we want to do FBA with local warehousing which will generate the most sales (my expectation due to prime) we need to have VAT numbers of the countries where we store our inventory. That would be 7 countries and is ‚Ç¨150 per country through Amazon. Besides that there is a monthly VAT service but since we‚Äôre already selling in Europe I don‚Äôt think this is needed although I can‚Äôt find any information about this.¬† The goal is obviously to be probitable on Amazon and I think the reach will be broader than our current target audience making volumes higher as well.¬†
2024-06-24,"Ah I see. I would suggest you start with storing inventory in one EU country (for example Germany). It would make you qualify for Amazon buy box in all EU marketplaces. But you will pay more to ship outside Germany (let us say to Spain).

In this stage you need to these VAT filings:

1. Your local quarterly/monthly VAT filing (It looks like you are Dutch, so in this case NL VAT filings)
2. Your Germany VAT filings monthly/quarterly depending on volumes. You can get Amazon service for this or get another third party. We use an external service which is somewhat expensive, but a lot more reliable. You can also do this yourself if you understand enough German.
3. Your OSS VAT filings. You file this on NL Belastingdienst but as a separate filing. All your sales from NL/DE to other EU countries need to go there. You can do this yourself or hire someone.

In any case, you should be doing 1 and 3 already. So only the second step is additional. You have to do this when you store inventory in another EU country independent of whether you are selling on Amazon or not.

Then you can expand to other countries if you see the market is big enough and if the shipping costs are high.

I can not judge if these costs and admin overheads are affordable for your business. It really depends on your scale, margins and your business appetite."
2024-06-24,Negative upt error on Amazon‚Äôs end
2024-06-26,Amazon just breached its previous all time high from back in 2021.  Chart is very bullish.  With forward earnings of around 40 its value is very favourable compared to historical.  This will keep going up.

2024-06-27,Amazon sells the same Temu Chinese garbage at exorbitant prices. That's why Temu is eating their lunch.

2024-06-30,I am busted. Amazon caught me. I just planted a crop of mechanical engine parts. I was expecting a record engine spark plug harvest this year.
2024-06-29,"I got hit with a bunch of seed and plant issues as well.  Thankfully, so far this is with dead listings that I don't care about it.  Amazon is so broken!"
2024-06-29,"Oh wow what a relief to see this post!

Of course this happens when I‚Äôm on vacation and I have multiple coworkers spamming me about it‚Ä¶ lol

Had happened to us in the past, but this time it‚Äôs hundreds! Was 150 ASINs by midday and seems like double now, we have nothing remotely close to seeds/plants, and in a Friday evening what a pain how classic!

2024-07-01,rotten food in the pick pods seriously amazon needs to drop selling alot of human food and animal food altogether until they can  put that shit in a facility where it can actually be stored properly not next to laundry detergent/bear spray and all sorts of other random stuff they sell the reason I will never order any type of food online from them ever and most people wouldn't either if they knew how the food was stored before they ordered it
2024-07-03,Where did you obtain your products? Your supplier should be able to help you in direct communication with the brand. The owner of a company sold directly to me and told me to sell them on Amazon and 3 months later her lawyer hit me up. I got it sorted with a email to her and him.
2024-07-03,"This is a legit cease and desist letter from the owner of the brand you are selling. I would reach out to them and ask them for authorization to sell. They are threatening to escalate to court, and can also file an IP complaint with Amazon since you are using their trademarks without permission.  Honestly you‚Äôre pretty lucky they are contacting you directly first instead of filing an IP complaint. If that happens your account could be suspended or even deactivated."
2024-07-03,"At the end of the day‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt have A LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION. And INVOICES they can file IP complaints and remove you. Amazon won‚Äôt relist your products. 

Now‚Ä¶ if you suspect the letter to be fake and that they don‚Äôt own the trademarks they are claiming you are infringing, then do nothing and you can wait to see if you get hit with an IP complaint.

I would work on getting invoices and a letter of authorization from the brand owner"
2024-07-03,"The next step might be that the brand will play their ""counterfeit without a test buy"" card with Amazon, and put your entire seller account at risk.    
  
They certainly can also sue under ""trademark infringement"" for unauthorized sales without the ""quality control"" they assure via their legit dealers/distributors."
2024-07-03,"It's worth a reminder that Temu is considered a bad actor by *other Chinese companies* and is being sued over it.

2024-07-19,"If you have a fully optimized product, then you're next step is marketing. Do you know all the keywords associated with your product? Do you know how many other sellers have skus associated with these keywords. Why get discouraged? You are making progress slowly and learning a lot. You thought it was a get rich quick scheme, but instead you have realized it's an earn extra money slow scheme. Just do the work and you'll see results. Pay someone on fiver to run your ASIN data through helium 10.

You're not selling a product. You're selling keywords with a pic of a product. Someone is ranking better for those keywords. This means they are driving traffic from outside of Amazon. Don't try to bring your customers to you with Amazon ads, go to where the customers are and drive them with a referral link. Is your product on Pinterest? Do you have pins for this? What about tik tok? Can you find an influencer that has a following that would like your product? Reach out to influencers and offer to send them a free product and pay them and give them a referral bonus to talk about your product. People use social media to find stuff, they already know what they want when they go to Amazon. Make sense?"
2024-07-19,"I don‚Äôt have anything helpful to say other than I am in a similar boat. We had absolutely no problem making sales from PPC however the problem was we weren‚Äôt even breaking even.

The ad spend was costing us a fortune, I think after a while, fine tuning and optimising PPC to a point where they‚Äôre the most effective would make it worthwhile in the long run but the problem is you need to accept a lot of that loss for quite a while until you get to the sweet spot.

It‚Äôs a real shame. Our product was costing us around $3 to buy and deliver to Amazon. We were selling them at around $12. Roughly $6 in Amazon fees. Before taking into account PPC, we were looking at almost 30% profit on our cheapest product. In the end it was costing us a lot more than that for the PPC so we had to take a step back and re-evaluate our options really"

2024-07-20,Greatest threat is Amazon itself accusing you of something their systems flag as abusive seller behavior when in fact you have done nothing wrong and then suspending your account with (almost) no chance of getting reinstated.

2024-07-20,"Hi, 

No doubt selling on Amazon can be tricky and comes with its own set of problems like everything else. 

Some sellers run into issues with competitors who might try to mess with their business by leaving negative reviews or undercutting prices. This can make it tough to stay competitive and maintain a good standing.

Thanks"
2024-07-21,My life has become infinitely more enjoyable since Amazon went from 100% of our revenue to 20%. I almost wish it was 0. It is truly an evil empire. Total scum.
2024-07-21,"Dodgy stuff happens every day. The severity of it varies.

From Amazon, at least monthly I'm feuding about some way Amazon is costing me. Usually it's just a few hundred dollars and I chalk it up to business. Sometimes it's $10k and it can take months to resolve in a peaceful way. Other times I give up. It's not worth losing the Amazon marketplace, even though I'm right and anyone that actually read the situation would agree that I'm right.

From other sellers? Pretty rarely for my niches thankfully. A lot of damage can be done, not just through normal channels, but back channels too. Petty revenge could cost you.

From buyers? Every single day. But that's the cost of doing business."
2024-07-23,My last Amazon physical product ever. Amazon are scum with hardware. My Amazon tablet is garbage. Fire stick is too slow. And now Alexa is being crippled. Never again¬†
2024-07-23,"So Alexa was always meant to be a loss leader. It was just another touch point to get the consumer more reliant on Amazon. Every single one of these articles seems to omit that very important fact. Maybe new leadership decided that Alexa had to make money, but that undermines the whole point of all the Amazon devices, sell them cheap, subsidize with adds, get the consumer more reliant on the Amazon ecosystem. Eventually you rug pull since that is how monopolies work. The title of all these articles should be ""massive tech monopoly complains about not making enough money and prepares to fuck customers"""
2024-07-23,"This is a clear case where Amazon Product Managers aren't eating their own dogfood.  Too much focus on profitability, not nearly enough on meeting user's needs."
2024-07-23,"The entire point of Amazon's connected system, network and monopoly is so I can have Whole Foods deliver my mom breakfast 300 miles away, yell at the driver for stepping on the lawn, ensure she doesn't trip her walker on the carpet and doesn't choke to death while eating. Then reordering her medicine and shoes that fit for her monthly outside activity and making sure her social security check was properly delivered.

This can't happen if she has to scream her name, phone number, social security number, prescription number, credit card number, house number, etc into a tiny speaker that doesn't work with her hearing aid. It also doesn't happen when it gets confused and starts talking to her about google search results, which get weird quickly and has talk about *Call Of The Midwife* and Ireland turn into aggressive, arguementative, frustrating information dumps about abortion, fetal miscarriage, rape, and people killed in The Troubles. I leave her alone with Alexa talking about sheep, 5 min later they're now talking about STEM cell research and Gasglow bus timetables. Though, god forbid it does start working with hearing aids and she starts talking to it in bed at night. I can only imagine the type of shit alexa would program into her. 

Versus, just using a screen and pressing the pictures."
2024-07-24,"We had something similar happen to us and we managed to outsmart the other sellers.   Our company logo was trademarked so the box the product came in had our logo on it and we included a promote (stress ball) with our company logo on it and included that in the product photo.   When listings came up, we filed a complaint with Amazon legal counsel for trademark infringement and they pulled the listing down almost instantly.   


Before we figured out how to handle this via trademark, we noticed some sellers were charging for shipping based on weight, so we changed the listing to be 5000 lbs which made their shipping $10,000 on a $29 product.  We did however bait the seller by changing the weight to 60lbs, he then lowered the price to $0.01 and $29 in shipping, but we then put our listing on hold and overnight dropped the weight of the product to 0.01oz so he collected $1 for a $29 product that he had to fulfill.  The seller eventually gave up and terminated the listing."
2024-07-24,"Look into Amazon's brand registry program.  Once you are set up with this you have more power to report violations.

You probably will want to create a listing for your product on Amazon when you do this.  Not as much motivation for them to enforce your brand if you're not even selling it there.

Doing a ""test buy"" to prove a product is counterfeit is a strategy that amazon seller support is familiar with and even ecourages... however, if it's 100+ listings that will get tedious.

Are you positive it's actually counterfeit, and not your offshore supplier selling your product to others (or directly on amazon)?"
2024-07-24,"Amazon is famous for doing this.  It's why so many people hate Amazon.  Good luck, I hope someone has useful advice for you.  Also I would have your  company attorney contact Amazon and at the very least tell them what is happening...even if Amazon doesn't take their listings down, you will be on record documenting this.  Also of course take screenshots."
2024-07-24,"Its rough and happens a lot.  

I do have some thoughts on it. 

* Do you have to sell online?  I started off selling online 12 years ago but stopped 10 years ago.  I get plenty of business from local sales and commercial sales and word of mouth.  Once you list stuff online its out there for other to see and copy.  I noticed it happening to me.  They can't do it now though.  They don't know what my products look like or how well they sell. 
* Make your product better.  Most people will see and figure it out.   There is a big woodworking tool company in Ohio called Woodpecker Tools.  They make high end measurement things.  One off tools.  They have a red color and lots of Chinese companies try to copy the designs and look.  But you can tell by looking at them. And by using them.  So even though I know I can get a cheap copy for $10 I'll buy the real one for $100.  
* Compete against them on amazon. That is a great way to hurt their business.  Make it clear on the listing that you are the real deal.    There are amazon users that will try to help you.  See, I'm a amazon vine member. I get free items in exchange for doing reviews.  I make it a point to find companies that are based in the USA that are making and selling stuff on there.  I request the products and do great reviews for them.  Its not much help, but I Try to do my best.  
* Do the legal thing. Its possible, but hard.  They have 100s of cheap workers that can list things and move them around to stay ahead of you.  Amazon isn't exactly known for being great about it.  
* The first thing I would do is to watermark you images from your website.  Let them steal those.  Put you website address on the images."

I had to pay for advertising and went broke fkng around with Amazon. I had to have the Amazon warehouses send all my products back. It was a complete mess
2024-07-30,"You don't actually need a registered business to sell on Amazon. You can just jump in as an individual seller. 

But hey, if you're thinking big, it might be worth setting up a proper business. It could save you some headaches down the road, especially if things really take off.

Hope that helps!"
2024-07-31,"Its not true in most companies. But he is right about it at Amazon. The common quip is it varies a lot across teams. But people move around a lot so fundamentals dont change across teams that much. Fundamentally its a dog eat dog culture. There are tons and tons of nice people all over, and being nice doesnt work against you for sure. But there are way more examples of aggression paying off."

Pay is first rate, job security, not great but solid benefits. I mean, it‚Äôs just a job for me , not a career so maybe I see it differently than some."

2024-08-09,"All great ideas, you should do well!  

Instead of shouting a bunch of random ideas at you - help us help you - what due diligence have you done? Which apps/features have you reviewed, which are you considering, what is stopping you?  

Yes, on amazon, you want to make sure you always have inventory available and deliveries are made in a timely manner - if your inventory is off or deliveries are delayed - this can highly affect your seller account.  

Website - wouldn't your Shopify website be your main concern? You could go with square instead.  

As for marketing - check out etsy - you'll see 7,000 competitors / similar products - so this will give you a good idea of how you'll need to make your advertising better / more unique / more appealing.  

Best wishes"

He's alright Amazon-wise -- we cross paths every so often at conferences, but truth be told, the most successful agencies I'm aware of are all GREAT B2B marketers who are good at getting and operating 7-8 fig Amazon businesses for 8-9 fig B&M brands.  IMHO he's one of the best Youtube-y guys in the business and that's his differentiator -- most every agency basically lines up good B2B Sales teams, hits up conferences, and gets business that way.

re: his PL account - it's likely it's his public demo account (like Manny with his ""How Cool Is That"" account run by H10).  Very few agencies with a PL share their main store or big SKUs, because nobody wants 1000 wannabes launching clones of their product."

UPS is like doing non-con or ship dock at Amazon, except UPS doesn't have a 50 pound limit and you're expected to do so at a much faster pace than at Amazon.


They daydream about UPS because it's union, but they would be in for a rude awakening when they realize that a blue-collar union doesn't protect lazy workers.


Yes, UPS **drivers** (not warehouse workers) earn a lot, but you need to be a warehouse worker for literally years before having a chance at becoming a driver."
2024-08-16,"It's the managers and PAs who make it feel like slavery or not depending on how they treat you. I worked the hardest when a manager was very nice to me, always asking how I was, smiling when he saw me and he always thanked me for my job. I felt very happy and didn't mind the hard work. But then everything changed, new managers came in, they looked at me with disdain, it made me feel like was unworthy. I asked for their id once because the machine wasn't giving me gloves with my ID and they just looked at me like I was a rat and threw the keys at me, when I gave them back they grabbed the keys and gave me their back... it's that attitude that makes me feel like a slave. When they look down on you and when they don't appreciate the work you do and want more and more ... I'm always quitting or transferring to other Amazon because of the managers"

2024-08-17,"I am seriously considering leaving. I just talked to my husband about it. I am in fresh department so I don‚Äôt know how different the other sites are. Yes, this is definitely an easy job. Yes, there is no other job that as long as you have time you can take it. No questions asked. I love the friends I have made there, but management sucks. They don‚Äôt know what they are doing. I am in the top five for picking and receiving every single week. I bust my butt, but for what? Every critical role I have been in was taken away because I kid you not I did too good of a job. Imagine that. Doing too good of a job, and being pulled from it. Most of the associates working there can be my child or grandchild and I run circles around them. I am (58f). But I am sore. My body aches every day when I leave there, and I can‚Äôt do anything at home because I ache so much. I have been at Amazon for almost 4 years. I don‚Äôt have anything else lined up, but for my peace of mind I need to leave. I still feel horrible about it though because I have always been a responsible person. I don‚Äôt like feeling like this though, and in pain every day. I deserve better."
2024-08-17,"While I respect you for wanting to leave. Personally speaking I am very ‚Äúcontent‚Äù being at Amazon 7 years. I understand the job ain‚Äôt for everyone but if you can handle the same thing everyday it really not as bad as people say it is. Yes it does suck and I bitch daily but ultimately it‚Äôs an easy job. 

1. I have better benefits than I‚Äôve had at ANY of my previous jobs. I had a $96k surgery in 2022 and my insurance through Amazon paid it ALL. 

2. As much as I bitch about how crap our pay is on a daily basis and how we should make more (we should), I do make more than a lot of places without needing a degree. 

3. You will NEVER work a job that has better time off opportunities. Not only do I get sick, personal, vacation and UPT, but I literally just came back to work after taking a month off with personal leave of absence because I needed a break from being in that sauna of a warehouse. I knew I had enough money for bills and living expenses for the month so I was good to go. Just had to give a 2 week notice. What job will just let you take a month off for no reason? Not to mention some days I just decide to leave early which I can do at Amazon if I have the time to cover it. 

I also happen to like the people I work with. Well the ones I‚Äôve worked with for years anyways. I truly have made good friends at work. 

Also I just wanted to add that if you‚Äôre going back to school (I‚Äôm assuming college) then you should WANT to work at Amazon cause they would be playin for your schooling? 

Like I say, Amazon ain‚Äôt for everyone and I understand why people don‚Äôt wanna work here but honestly if you can stick with it it‚Äôs not that bad.


My advice after being here 7 years is stay at the bottom. Then you‚Äôre invisible. Also don‚Äôt try TOO hard because then they will expect it from you everyday. I was Psolve for a while and I was NEVER offered the VTO because they ‚Äúneeded me‚Äù. Like they wouldn‚Äôt even tell me there was VTO and when a friend would tell me and I would go and ask for it they would laugh. I did that for a couple years before I realized it‚Äôs not worth it to me so I eventually stepped down. I‚Äôve been asked many times to apply for ASM as well but I won‚Äôt. So many ASMs at my site say it ain‚Äôt worth it. So I stay comfortably at a T1 level and stay mostly invisible. 

Maybe it‚Äôs just me that feels this way but eh. Good luck on whatever you do next OP. I do agree tho fuck Amazon haha."
2024-08-17,"Honestly, you sound a bit immature. Yeah, I don't think anyone wants to work at Amazon forever or their dream job. However, decent benefits and programs that help you move out of Amazon like career choice. You could literally get a CDL from Amazon and make more than an OM in under three months or use career choice and get a fully paid for bachelor's degree from WGU in like two years. Do you have a backup job? It sounds like you just had a bad day at work and made a rash decision."
2024-08-18,"Hi, 

I understand that it might seem unusual for a service provider not to share details about their past work or clients. From our side, we sometimes have agreements with our clients that prevent us from disclosing their information. This is because the details of their accounts are their property, and they decide if and how their stats can be shared.

To make things easier and more secure for our clients, we only ask for payment once the work is done. This way, you don‚Äôt have to worry about paying in advance and can be sure that you‚Äôre only paying for work that meets your expectations. We‚Äôre confident that our clients will be happy with our services and choose to work with us again in the future. However, we also understand that some people might not pay after the work is completed, and we accept that as part of the business. This is a common practice that only legit Service provider follows. 

I‚Äôm not sure about Eric Walsh or his legitimacy, but I would suggest not paying anything in advance when working with anyone. If someone is truly passionate and skilled at what they do, they wouldn‚Äôt ask for money upfront because they‚Äôre confident they will get paid for their work. 

If you‚Äôre looking for help with selling on Amazon and want to avoid paying in advance, let me know. I can give you more details about how we can assist you. Thanks!

Thanks"

Africa is a continent of many countries all with different levels of affluence, infrastructure, and culture. One of Amazon's pillars of success is its logistics network. It's much easier to set this kind of network set up in America than Africa, and to maintain it due to geopolitical and terrorist risks. The types of products the different demographics would demand throughout the continent would be too broad to have efficiency with inventory.¬† ¬†


I wouldn't bet on it."
2024-08-31,"Are you American? I only ask as most Americans tend to not have as strong a grasp on geographies and perspectives. 

Africa is a continent. It is the second largest continent on the planet after Asia. Africa is three times as large as the US on a land mass basis. Expecting one company to dominate e-commerce in Africa is the same as expecting Amazon to dominate e-commerce in the North *and* South American continents, and Alibaba to dominate e-commerce in *all* of Asia. 

It‚Äôs impossible. The land mass is too big, the population too undocumented and the infrastructure too variable. 

However Jumia can be successful if it just focuses on a few countries in say East Africa, rather like Sea Ltd in South East Asia. But even this will take a long time to build out logistics and even longer to churn out a profit (we‚Äôre talking a decade at least). 

But the whole of Africa? Impossible."

2024-09-09,"Yeah, this is very common. You might want to just go through the process of setting up an example shipment from a foreign country - the Send to Amazon flow will give you an idea of what info you need, etc. Basically if your manufacturer is arranging shipping (which they almost always can), then you just need to create the shipment in Amazon, print off labels (for individual units if you're doing that vs. a manufacturer barcode) and each box. The manufacturer will apply them and ship everything to the Amazon warehouse, and it'll be received as normal.

I pressed Play‚Äîone full-minute ad. I can't skip.
Fifteen minutes later (or maybe 20, I don't remember), another unskippable one-minute ad. I took a break, then came back, ads.

I remember the ads more than the episode itself. All three items can be bought on Amazon (Amazon thinks customers are stupid). 

I gave up. I'm not going to watch episodes full of ads. They are distracting. They make the fast-forward rewind functionalities extremely painful. Even for Dune 2, which I paid for, I had to see them at the start or after a quick break.

I watch far fewer movies or series on Amazon now. A series really has to be unique to be worth watching. You don't know when Ring Of Power will start being interested. You can't fast forward the boring part because you must watch ads at set moments. You can't rewind if you missed something because you're afraid you'll have to watch ads.

Prime Video looks like a cheap version of Netflix. 
Now, Amazon asks you to pay more to avoid their ads. Why would I pay more when the more exciting stuff you have to rent or buy?

2024-09-16,Amazon seems like the worst of the big tech companies to work for by far
2024-09-17,"How the headline should read: ""Amazon changes policy to reduce workforce by 12% without having to pay severance. """
2024-09-16,"Sounds like a good time to maliciously comply. Of course you go back to the office. And do absolutely nothing of value. You also leave all the work at the office. Still showing up on time and leaving on time.

If Amazon wants to play the benchwarmer requirement game then be just that, be a benchwarmer."
2024-09-17,">I'd rather go back to school  than work in an office again

Now if that isn't a damning indictment of Amazon, I don't know what is."
2024-09-17,"Is he going back into the office 5 days a week?  What about the rest of Amazon's ""Senior leadership""?  Probably not....but they will be traveling around on Amazon's dime, staying at their points motels, and racking up miles on their medallions so they can go back and forth from their lavish homes and Amazon offices to give the perception that they too are returning to office."
2024-09-17,I‚Äôm amazed Amazon actually gets employees. I‚Äôve never heard anyone say anything nice about working for them.
2024-09-18,"Of course he'll backtrack.

1. He'll lose a lot of hard-to-replace employees who have plenty of offers out there.
2. He'll be stuck with a lot of workers he had hoped would leave...you know, the ones they toss out with PIPs.
3. Economy will pick up, more new companies opening and seeking talent.
4. Amazon recruiters pushing that they can't find highly skilled tech workers because competitors are offering decent salaries and 100% remote work in writing.
5. Jasso, Dimon, and others will make speeches claiming remote work hurts your career and remote workers are not loyal/dedicated, and end up being demonized on social media.
6. Jasso caves because he has no choice...might try allowing only ""hard to replace"" people to be remote and require ""easy to replace"" people to be in the office 5 days a week with no exception.
7. Rinse and repeat...he'll try again to kill remote work in a year or so when shareholders give him crap about empty offices."
2024-09-18,"I doubt Jassy will backtrack, his ego is too large to do so.

I do think other tech firms or large business, who normally look to Amazon as a trend setter for decisions like this, won‚Äôt follow suit and keep their WFH or 3 day hybrid schedules though. This was a very ego driven decision by Jassy and the Amazon board and not set in any sort of productive reasoning. 

Other companies probably see this as an opportunity to hire people who leave Amazon due to this asinine policy and thus will keep their WFH or hybrid options."
2024-09-18,He won‚Äôt. Amazon doubles down on stupid so often
2024-09-19,Amazon handing out carrots after hanging a giant stick. Restore balance they must.
2024-09-19,"Careful folks, Amazon's pr team is in this thread downvoting any critical opinions."
2024-09-19,"Wow! Sponsoring and selling cheap Chinese crap from oddly named companies like Pukemark and NoCry, and MaxLax (yes, they're real) is paying off. Glad Amazon is sharing in the profits."
2024-09-20,"I totally agree! I say no to everything, just let me do the tier one job and I will do it better than anybody else. Pick somebody else to be a water spider or whatever other thing you‚Äôre recruiting for‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not falling for it lol I walk out the door and I don‚Äôt think about Amazon until my next shift. That‚Äôs priceless."
2024-09-22,"Anybody that says working at Amazon is an insult, deserves to be insulted themselves. It's not the greatest job, but it pays the bills, and puts food on the table."
2024-09-22,"I use to be a pharmacy tech , believe me I was terrible at it but it did look legit hard . Part of the reason I did it was for benefits and pay , I was told it was a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù by my parents and not a job so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better. Working here I can zone out and just do my work, it‚Äôs nice . 4 days off , vto and upt and vacation to use , plus amazon prime now. It‚Äôs a better job than most . At the end of the day a lot of jobs are getting replace by robots"
2024-09-22,"I agree with him when you worked for an actual career and have to step down into Amazon that's not a ""W"".  Especially since it pays significantly less and not only that you get injured and treated like shit.  Again there are perks to working here but like the other associate it's embarrassing to be here.  For the people calling it unskilled  work I don't believe that.  It definitely take skills to be a robot for 10-12+ hours.  I've seen alot of people break down physically and mentally while others are content being bots.  There's people on this sub that have worked in this pace for 7+ years as a T1 that's incredible to my eyes.  It definitely takes some skill to put up with shit here."
2024-09-23,"From the article:
‚ÄúBlackstone, the private equity firm led by Stephen Schwarzman, a billionaire backer of Donald Trump, was cited in the report for its roles in funding far-right political movements, investments in fossil fuel projects and deforestation in the Amazon.
‚ÄúBlackstone‚Äôs network has spent tens of millions of dollars supporting politicians and political forces who promise to prevent or eliminate regulations that might hold it to account,‚Äù the report noted.
The Vanguard Group was included in the report due to its role in financing some of the world‚Äôs most anti-democratic corporations. ExxonMobil was cited for funding anti-climate science research and aggressive lobbying against environmental regulations.
Even in ‚Äúrobust democracies‚Äù workers‚Äô demands ‚Äúare overwhelmed by corporate lobbying operations, either in policymaking or the election in itself‚Äù, said Todd Brogan, director of campaigns and organizing at the ITUC.‚Äú"

2024-09-25,"$2.50.

In all seriousness, these didn't take off because they were difficult platforms from a website perspective. They came about because they were novel ideas, and they had the backbone to support it. Amazon started out only selling books. They built an enormous warehousing and distribution system for books. Once that was running they started opening it up to other goods - on an existing distribution platform."
2024-09-25,"Okay so realistically a project like that is what we call enterprise level software. This means you'll either need an agency and pay them a few hundred thousand dollars to get up and going then for ongoing support ect...

  
However have I got a opportunity for you! the job market took a huge tank in America and you could probably hire a developer around 70-200k a year, probably take a bit longer to start than an agency with just 1 or 2 developers. Do most tech startups fail, absolutely amazon didn't set out to be the next ebay, they had a better business model and scaled it over time. Also storing a website like that may cost tens of thousands of dollars a month on a server. You'd need investors, and experienced people working with you."
2024-09-25,"I mean, Bezos started in his garage, so probably not a lot. But that was decades ago and I sincerely doubt you could build something like that the same way today.

I'd say you'd need at least a billion dollars to just materialize a platform like Amazon out of thin air and actually keep it afloat and pay for extensive marketing so it has the opportunity to survive. Just spit balling here.

Imo, the best bet is to try to compete with etsy. A lot of both sellers and buyers are fed up with etsy and they don't have any viable competitors. Granted, the lack of competitors isn't because no one has tried.. If you could make a quality platform that ONLY allows handmade goods and could reasonably compete with etsy you might be on to something. I still think it would take quite a bit of money.. You could probably pull it off for a fraction of trying to compete with Amazon though."
2024-09-25,"How ""Anonymous"" are these surveys really in large companies like Amazon?"
2024-09-25,"Here is how this is going to play out. It's a trainwreck that most of us can see coming a mile away:

* Top talent will straight up leave. They will be able to get jobs elsewhere.
* Reliable employees will start to slowly look for jobs. It won't be immediate - but when they do find work, even if it means a salary reduction, they will leave. Look for this to take 2 to 3 years. During this timeframe, they will not be nearly as engaged and their overall productivity will nosedive. They won't work extra hours. They won't ""go the extra mile"". And the certainly won't be good mentors for newer employees.
   * Smaller companies and startups will continue to be able to poach Amazon employees. They will offer lower salaries but temper it with full time WFH. Many of these companies will be competing directly with various Amazon services/products.
* Unreliable employees will continue to be unreliable. But now they are unreliable AND they are grouchy at having to commute into the office. So... even more unreliable.
* New employees will either be trained by formerly reliable employees who no longer care OR by unreliable employees who never cared in the first place. 

There is no scenario where Amazon is better off in 3 years. People can try to spin this as ""Amazon is laying people off without laying people off"" but it is way past that at this point. The people they are going to lose are NOT the people they want to lose."
2024-09-25,"As someone who works remotely myself I completely empathize with Amazon's employees because it's been so life-altering. On a base level, I no longer have to contend with some of the worst rush hour traffic in the country or endure inconsiderate assholes on the train watching TikTok trash without headphones. 

More significant are the cost savings, availability for my family and the ability to live in a nice, safe but more affordable community. Who the hell wants to give any of that up? Unlike these obsessive workaholics, most people have other priorities in their lives."
2024-09-25,I literally didn't go in the past 3 days and nobody cares. Can anybody else other than Amazon say the same thing?
2024-09-25,And they‚Äôre probably the same ones that are in the waiting room for Amazon to open up hiring(in some areas). This economy rn ain‚Äôt one to be picking and choosing where to work anyways.
2024-09-25,"Just look through this reddit and you will easily find people claiming Amazon is slave labor and everyone at Amazon is out to get them.

Those same people are telling everyone they know about how Amazon screwed them over and didn't listen to them when they said they couldn't do cross training because it's not fair. Or whatever other reason they can think of to be mad at because amazon didn't give them exactly what they wanted."
2024-09-25,So I work at Amazon and also go to college. There‚Äôs been multiple occasions in my business classes where the professor is talking about Amazon‚Äôs slave labor practices and we‚Äôre reading about some Amazon horror story. sometimes they‚Äôll ask if anyone works at Amazon but I stay silent because my experience doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative they want to push. I‚Äôll never advocate for this company but I definitely don‚Äôt feel like I work in some sweatshop environment
2024-09-25,Nice response. I bet he would've changed his tune if no one but Amazon took in his convicted ass.
2024-09-26,Amazon will succeed in their purpose for this: soft layoffs that don't require paying severance packages.
2024-09-26,Amazon will just be stuck with H1B workers that can‚Äôt go elsewhere.
2024-09-26,"One suspects that was one of the desires of Amazon when implementing the return to office scheme.

If people quit of their own accord than & won't have to pay severance for making them redundant."
2024-09-26,"Here‚Äôs the problem: most companies will not, contractually, commit to giving us a fully remote role on paper.

In the rare cases that they do, they will find a way to limit it to just the one specific role. So essentially we‚Äôre not promotable. Even lateral move to another title will terminate it.

Most companies will follow the big players - like Amazon - with this mandate. It totally sucks when you were recruited and hired with the promise of fully remote, then switched to hybrid, then full RTO. The company will not bump your compensation to compensate for the commute cost (car, time, gas, etc). So I‚Äôd say you were hired remote at 20% to 25% below what on-site positions pay, the pay remains but you‚Äôd now be required to be on-site.

It doesn‚Äôt help that the market is soft right now. 

We need to survive another 6 to 9 months until the dust settles from the interest rate cuts and post election stability."

2024-09-30,Fuck Amazon and their managers L8 and above.
2024-09-30,With FBM too many people know that Amazon will refund them  will claim that item wasn‚Äôt delivered. Way too much fraud on this platform that doesn‚Äôt exist anywhere else.
2024-09-29,"This can depend heavily on your product category and your product quality. If all is normal, you should expect somewhere around 5%

For example clothing has a higher return rate due size and fit, along with style expectation. 
If you sell a product that needs a lot of education to work, or if it just doesn‚Äôt do what it advertises to do, then your returns would be higher.

It‚Äôs rare that you get people that abuse the Amazon return policy, but this also depends on categories as those bad apples are more likely to abuse returns with electronics vs home decor."
2024-09-30,Morale at Amazon has been in the shitter for some time. This just keeps in there.
2024-09-30,Andy Jassy can eat a bag of Amazon Basics dicks. Amazon was already a shit place to work and under his leadership continues to get worse.

2024-09-30,"None of my friends who work for Amazon‚Äôs engineering teams (AWS, AI) are considering to quit. They think 5 days is stupid but none of them work too far from home so it‚Äôs more of a nuisance than a dealbreaker.

I think much of the dissent are from the folks that are looking at a long commute."

2024-10-02,Normal amazon tactic. The whole basics line are stolen hot selling products. You can't do anything about it other than make your own store.
2024-10-02,Yeah. This is very common Amazon tactic. They‚Äôve noticed skin care is hot and massive margins.
2024-10-02,They take the listing and raise prices. These issues should be brought to the FTC to add to their case and force Amazon to explain it. I have no doubt they will claim some of the goods are fake or not perfect in some way. At the VERY least you should be allowed to sell what you have at Amazon before they take things over. Any bad sellers should be pulled off. Amazon does this and then asks sellers how are they doing with those surveys etc. In person they tend to feign ignorance or take notes and say very little.
2024-10-02,That‚Äôs their sales pitch to the brands. Sell to us and we will remove all the 3rd party sellers. But once the brand ends that relationship Amazon will let everyone sell it again. It‚Äôs nice once that happens. Amazon opens the flood gates on these brands.
2024-10-02,"I work in Skincare, there's a Premium Beauty category that once you that brand gets put in by Amazon (either 3P premium Beauty or 1P) it does what you say happened. That's the world of Premium Beauty. It's normal"
2024-10-02,The brands don‚Äôt last with Amazon. So just involve your lawyers at least for the sake of your money.
2024-10-04,Are you seriously asking if its possible to kick amazon off of a listing?
2024-10-04,"I hate when brands do this. I don't even understand the point. We sell our products on Amazon. We also sell our products in Costco. Sometimes seller buy our products from Costco to resell at Amazon (at the end of the season they usually win the buy box because they are doing heavy discounts). The way we see it is that it's a win win for everyone. We still get to sell a unit from Costco, the Amazon buyer still receive our product, at a cheaper price that we would sell it for, and the RA seller makes his (tiny) profit."
2024-10-04,"This seems inauthentic, if it‚Äôs not from Amazon then would just disregard it and go on about your business. Responding to it just tells whoever that you are aware and may harass you more. If they have an issue with what you sell, which is through Amazon then let them complain to Amazon who then can authenticate the legitimacy of their complaint."
2024-10-04,"Your actions depend entirely on your account health and if the product profitability is worth the stress/ hassle of dealing with this company. If you give them what you are being asked for, you are correct they would likely blacklist you.  or this is fraudulent and it‚Äôs another seller trying to get your source. Also - this is a very basic form letter shitty brand protection agencies use. 

At the end of the day, this is a misuse and violation of amazon seller messaging and pretty much everyone with some time in the ecosystem ignores this crap."
2024-10-04,"From what I hear it‚Äôs them not liking Amazon. They don‚Äôt like the company and they don‚Äôt like the price fluctuations. I never understood it personally. ‚ÄúIf you have a store front we will sell to you, but if you sell online, we won‚Äôt‚Äù, when chances are I‚Äôm gonna turn 2/4x more on Amazon than your retail storefront. Idk why they wont just adapt to the times, and realize we are the future of business, not some storefront sitting beside a target and Walmart that gets 20 customers a day."
2024-10-05,"Man, Amazon‚Äôs approach is going to kill it. Not today or tomorrow, but within a few years it‚Äôs going to be full of people who are there because they can‚Äôt find any other job. The number of applicants my company has received from Amazon‚Äôs top talent shows it‚Äôs going to be like the USSR and their brain drain. Top talent is now looking elsewhere, and they are even willing to take a pay cut just to get remote."
2024-10-05,I‚Äôm pretty sure their recent RTO policy was Amazon‚Äôs underhanded way of cutting their workforce.
2024-10-08,If you sell on Amazon you don‚Äôt have a brand. All the customer info is amazons not yours. No resells or upsells. No customer lifetime value. Their Amazons customers not yours. Shopify has a very easy back end plug in to use Amazon as a 3PL.
2024-10-08,"Your own website is a must for brands, even if you have to ship the product yourself, but if you cannot and your margin allows it, then do Shopify and have Amazon fulfill your orders through MCF (Multi Channel Fulfillment) where Amazon fulfills your Shopify orders from your fba inventory.

Here are SOME benefits of selling on your own website:

You own the data, not amazon , analytics, so you can directly communicate with your customers.

Amazon can turn you off one day just like that, it can be an error, it can be because you missed metrics‚Ä¶

Better for branding, drive traffic from social to your own website which can have anything you want, including product information, registration, education, customer service, email list. 

It‚Äôs much cheaper to sell on your own website vs amazon.

Cross selling, upselling, subscriptions, flexibility..."
2024-10-08,"Amazon IS a 3pl. You can fulfill shopify orders using Amazon MCF with a click of a button. 

It also keeps your stock in sync with your shopify product if you link the SKU"
2024-10-08,"Come on just because you‚Äôre in a bad spot don‚Äôt make the rest of the country suffer (customer obsession). Get that ass to work and fill those orders (take ownership). Have some pride in what you do, there shouldn‚Äôt be a better reason to risk your life (have a bias for action)‚Ä¶! Besides Amazon takes pride in how cheap they can build buildings (be frugal), so the building might withstand the storm (commit despite disagreements).

Trust me, I‚Äôm a leader! (Leaders are right, a lot)!

Besides if I‚Äôm wrong you‚Äôre family will get a great compensation for your death (think big) like life time prime membership and your 10% up to $100 discount for 5 years.

Obviously satire Stay safe!"
2024-10-08,During a week I call ‚Äúthe smoke week‚Äù Amazon had us work while there were active wildfires getting closer and closer. The smoke was so thick IN THE SITE and they gave us N-95 masks (which do nothing for smoke). They closed the site early every day and promised we would be paid for any time missed. They ended up not paying us and when I sent an e-mail saying I would go to the dept of Labor with the proof they said they‚Äôd pay us i saw a deposit for all the missing money an hour later. They see us as expendable. They do what they want. Trust
2024-10-14,"Five to nine direct reports, 12 max is a good rule. Amazon knows what its doing and no, i wont work for you."
2024-10-15,"1. 6 years (3 different brands, sold 1 for seven figures)  
2&3. Not sure off the top of my head. I do about $3M in revenue a year with around 38% margins.   
4. Start with a SMALL cheap product knowing that it will 99% fail. Use this cheap investment to learn everything about Amazon (e.g. how the campaign manager works, learning about brand registry, learning about listing suppressions, learning about pricing and competition, learning about creating images, learn about listing optimizations and keywords, etc.). GOOGLE EVERYTHING. Someone has answered ANY question you have about amazon somewhere on the internet. After you feel you understand everything, invest in more expensive product with high margin. Never go after recommend products on Helium10 and JungleScout."
2024-10-16,"1. 8 years  
2. Highest Monthly? Ever? Probably $300-$400k. Whatever I made April of 2020.   
3. $2.7m  
4. I pulled the vast majority of my products off Amazon in Q2 of last year (except the stuff that's literally been on autopilot since 2016, and does about $150k/year, and I spend about 20 hours/year on).

My advice to new 3rd party sellers is this: Amazon doesn't want you on its platform. They want factories/manufacturers selling directly to consumers. They literally talk about it all the time. Their three tenets are 1. Customers want a seamless shopping experience 2. Customers want the most options 3. Customers want the lowest price. 

#2. and 3. are 100% incorrect. They prove it incorrect everyday. My advice is your goal should be to GET OFF AMAZON. And that means starting a brand from scratch, preferably in a niche. Ask yourself if you really want to do that."
2024-10-15,"1. 10 years
2. Not sure, but it spiked in Covid 
3. Net net of everything c 5%  so call it $150k. 
4. I made a success of it, but I have managed to buy zero Lamborghinis. However I have managed to buy a warehouse full of stock of worth $500k. Lucky me.

@ Amazon is a bit of hit-and-miss - You need to launch several products because some will fail. The consumers and the algorithm are fickle and seemingly random. You need to run multiple successful products because you sometimes random things go wrong with them. You need to have reserves of cash and stock to see you through difficult situations.

@ Try and avoid extreme seasonal products.

@ Run on minimal stock at first. FBM if you can, until you spin up some regular sales and you generate a bit of cash to invest in more stock.

@ Sell good products on well made listings. Compromised products on poorly presented listings will sell more slowly - and you can‚Äôt fix these original sins with advertising or hope. 

@ Advertising is oil for the gears, not fuel for the engine. If it won‚Äôt sell organically then improve the offer or junk it. 

@ Finally don‚Äôt piss all your profits away on advertising - you will need those profits to launch more products and buy extra stock for when your turnover grows. And you are planning on growing aren‚Äôt you?"
2024-10-15,"Honestly these guys are giving some great advice. I would add though that not all people can afford to launch products and have them fail just to learn the platform. If your already a seasoned seller and have been making consecutive profits month after month chances are you started 2017-2019. Starting an FBA business from scratch in 2024-2025 is a whole different landscape than it was back then. Look at what Amazon as a company is doing and where they are reinvesting their capital. If you have a budget of less than $10k to invest In Amazon I would really think twice before even jumping in. I don't agree with the fact that you need a lawyer to get through the USPTO trademark process, of course unless your not a US based company. Everywhere you can cut expenses will had to your bottom line. Look at your competition, the big guys. Check their gross rev numbers and see how consolidated the sellers doing biggest numbers are. If your biggest competitors are selling 40k + units a month and have 20k reviews stay clear from these type of products unless you can somehow improve the product in a massive way. 

The good thing is that Amazon isn't going anywhere anytime soon. They are rapidly reinvesting back into the company and have tons of growth potential. They are planning on grabbing as much market share as they can not only in the US, but every other capitalistic economy that is on good terms with the US. My biggest issue now is 
1. Capital constraints and inventory credit control 
2. The unknown. As in it will be my first year where I have 2 good products, numbers are looking good, and not sure if  q4  or holiday seasons in general really perform as well as people are saying.

This is a business and not a get rich quick type of deal anymore. Just another source of income to add to your portfolio. Many new businesses have great gross revenue numbers but still operate at a loss for many different reasons. Amazons a bull and you have to take it by the horns and make it work for you."
2024-10-15,"There is an Amazon email, when you send a counterfeit notice to it. Amazon removes the seller first and asks questions later. Please research"
2024-10-15,"Is this reporting feature you're mentioning in the consumer-facing Amazon order page (where I made the order from)? Or is this reporting feature in Seller Central or Brand Registry. I've tried Brand Registry so many times that they've blocked my access now.

Did you report it as ""Trademark""  or ""Copyright"" (since ""Patent"" isn't applicable in this situation)?"
2024-10-15,"Are you using a credit card or a debit card? Ran into this before because Amazon has its head up its ass. The card you use cannot be a debit card whatsoever. Doesn't matter if there is a Visa symbol on it or not. They will only accept credit cards. Oh, they'll charge a debit card but you can't use one as the saved card on the account."
2024-10-15,"Have you received any Email from Amazon that says ""Balance paid on your account""?"
2024-10-15,"I recieved an email by them saying this:

Here is the translation to English:

‚ÄúWe have applied a charge to your credit card (MasterCard) for the amount of 39¬£ in order to settle your Selling on Amazon payment account. The amount charged may be less than the total owed if your bank has imposed a credit limit. If this is the case, we will continue to attempt to charge the credit card until the outstanding balance on your Selling on Amazon payment account has been fully paid.

You can also use the ‚ÄòMake a Payment‚Äô feature to settle your account. For more information, type ‚Äòmake a payment‚Äô in the Seller Central search bar.

To view your payment history, log in to your account and go to Reports > Payments.

2024-10-16,"It depends on a few factors, but generally speaking, the listing is removed, and will remain ineligible to be sold on your account in any way shape or form.

**How a Product Authenticity Complaint affects you:** If the violation has a corresponding ""AHR impact"" like low, medium, or high, then your Account Health Rating will be deducted points according to the severity (note: exact point values will vary relative to the severity and other internal factors, but you can track the difference in points by looking at your AHR before the deduction, and your points after the deduction). ""No impact"" means that no points have been deducted and only the listing itself is affected by being removed.

Example: If the impact is high, and your rating dropped from 244 to 236, then you know it was an 8 point deduction. Each violation is a one-time deduction, so in this scenario, your rating would remain at 236 unless acted upon by separate violations. If you accumulate enough violations to drop your score below 100, your account becomes at risk of imminent deactivation until you resolve enough violations to increase your rating to 100, or above.

**Appeal options for failed invoice/supplier scenario:** If you are unable to ""acknowledge"" the violation (admit fault to not providing valid, acceptable invoices) through the violation through the appeal button, and an invoice is the only option, then the violation will remain on your Account Health Page for 180 days, after which it will fall off and return your deducted points, but the listing will remain deactivated permanently for failing to prove authenticity.

If you're okay not selling the product, then it's best practice to delete the listing and allow the violation to fall off, unless you're comfortable ""acknowledging' The violation if you've been provided the option in the appeal button.

**Note about Acknowledgement appeals**: Acknowledging the violation, is **not** an admission to selling counterfeit product; it is an admission that you violated the policy which requires you to provide **valid** documentation from a **valid** supplier to verify authenticity. In other words, if your receipt/invoice does not pass Amazon's review, this means you ""violated"" their policy by not meeting document or supplier standards, and the ""acknowledgement"" appeal can be thought of as a forgiveness or pardon appeal. If the acknowledgement appeal is accepted, the violation will be removed within 60 seconds of submission. If the violation remains, then you'll know the acknowledgement appeal was unsuccessful and the violation will fall off after 180 days.

**Summary:**

1.Whether you choose to acknowledge the violation, or allow it to expire 180 days from the day it was received, the listing will remain deactivated due to the failed invoice review, and the listing should be deleted from your inventory to avoid further complications and clear up inventory space for easier inventory management.

2. Not all violations will be presented to you with an ""acknowledgement"" appeal, based on internal factors. You either have it or you don't. It's not an admission of guilt, but it's a business decision you have to consider if you're comfortable making it; for context it is intended to be use as a valid appeal option if a seller's invoices fail the review, and many sellers use it every day.

3. There countless variables in Amazon's review process that all boil down to one goal of verifying your invoice, and the supplier to verify authenticity and trustworthiness. Best practices for this situation are to consider your product sources with extreme caution and scrutiny, and implement your own strict vetting processes which may include things like consultation with a supply chain professional (not me), in-depth research, test buys, and ensuring that any final receipts and invoices meet Amazon's basic invoice guidelines, and you should have received a copy of these in your responses from Amazon. If you have a valid invoice from a valid supplier, and they can pass Amazon's review process, the violations can be resolved in as little as 1-3 days. Just try to avoid buying product indiscriminately and hoping for the best because **accumulated authenticity violations can put your account at risk**.

As always, follow Amazon's policies and verify all violation information with Amazon resources. Good luck."
2024-10-16,"Thank you for the extremely detailed response! Just to clarify - is there any risk that if I choose to allow the violation to expire in 180 days instead of trying to fight the claim, that Amazon may choose to deactivate my account even though my account health is above the threshold of 100?"
2024-10-16,"""Honey, you're not going to believe what I just bought off of Amazon!"""
2024-10-17,"Book reselling on Amazon is fairly risky at this point, so you aren't going to have much certainty.  Also books bought at Goodwill would only be used, not new which will reduce your risk a bit."
2024-10-17,If Amazon accepted your invoice. You‚Äôre good to go. They may re-ask in future. But for now you‚Äôre good. Ignore the people who probably do 1 sale/week and are tryna scare ya.
2024-10-17,"The invoice was conditionally accepted and once you send the inventory in, out of spite, Amazon will take the books, destroy them and close your account."
2024-10-17,"I'm not sure what is the best way for you in this situation, but account sharing, especially with CC / money involved - is an absolute nightmare. It's the opposite of ""best practices"". It's worst practice. Same with intermingling personal and business activities for the owner. One man shows don't even do this, why would a company with employees?

At LEAST get a second prime account for the company, and designate someone as the office manager that makes the actual orders, on a company card. Or get a business account and accept that you won't get free shipping, but you'll get some lower prices and they'll probably offset the shipping costs - and it'll DEFINITELY offset the costs if someone decides to embezzle via Amazon orders and you have no way of telling who it was because you're sharing a single account between 10 people.

This is a no brainer from a security perspective, I don't care how much these employees are trusted. You have to have a way to differentiate who did what or it becomes a finger pointing real life crime mystery WHEN something happens (not IF, but WHEN)."
2024-10-16,"Definitely the vocal minority. As long as you keep your head down and stay out of the bottom 5%, you‚Äôre good. 

I‚Äôve worked fast food and retail and let me tell you, Amazon is by far so much better. No customer facing positions, 40 hours set schedule guarantee, benefits, guaranteed overtime, and paid tuition. 

I will say it is hard on the body but I like to think of it as a free gym membership.

Congrats on the new job!"
2024-10-16,"In my experience, working at Amazon is a cheat code of a job. Great pay and benefits for what the work is, not physically strenuous especially for a warehouse job, good time off and leave options, and now they let you wear approved earbuds. Plus, people come and go all the time so if you hate it you can quit with the press of a button."

2024-10-17,"Including company contact info could be troublesome since Amazon wants to keep communication within their platform. We do include inserts asking for reviews, but not 5 star reviews and we don't include any company contact info."

I‚Äôd IMMEDIATELY pull out and be looking at other tech companies. I cannot imagine anyone who values any semblance of work life balance applying to Amazon after all of this. It‚Äôs so funny cause even working in tech everyone I know wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere near Amazon cause the culture is so bad, and that was before all of this. There are so many other similar tech companies that will pay the same, if not better than Amazon and you can still have a life outside of work. Idk why anyone in their right mind would go and work there now, too bad for them! They‚Äôre totally losing out on good talent because of this"

2024-10-22,"You can't use stamps because Amazon requires tracking. In the US, the cheapest option is USPS Ground Advantage. Theoretically, Amazon should be providing the cheapest rate available, but check the cost at Pirate Ship to keep them honest. 

Your profit margin calculations must include the cost of shipping. If the margin is too thin and you can't raise your price, then you do not have a viable product."

2024-10-22,Temu is certainly competing. They now have warehouses in the US like Amazon.
2024-10-22,"Yep.  Had another website totally redesign theirs to look like ours, but didn't stop at just copying the ""look and feel"".  They copied shipping and return policies verbatim as well as product info, bullet points, category names and some images.  Our company attorney sent them a cease and desist with extensive documentation including, similar to you, an email we received from one of their customers thinking we were them.

The basic tenant of trademark law is attempting to confuse the customer.  We took various screenshots of both sites so they could be compared side-by-side and were able to use the internet wayback machine (I think that is the name) to show what their website used to look like and what it looked like after the ""updates"".

Fortunately, it was not an outright scam site, but a real U.S. company in the industry looking to expand their eCommerce presence.  We still don't know if it was them hiring a bad website developer, or if it was done internally with intention, but we came to an agreement on acceptable changes to their site.  Competition is fine, but you can't try to confuse a customer re: what company you are.

We have had tables and text copied on Amazon and a few other sites, we have been less aggressive on those as they have been limited in scope and typically very poor sites or vendors overall.  Amazon, well, is Amazon.  The fact that they let companies jump your ASIN and thereby benefit from your images, videos and copy is ridiculous.  We now have a branded store on Amazon which has helped a bit, but it's still frustrating...we report when companies jump our ASIN and ship a different product, and we find out about it from the customer, but we generally get nowhere.  We try to keep Amazon as a small part of our overall business and see it almost as just an advertisement for our brand."

2024-10-27,Ever since the low inventory fees all of my products have incurred an extra dollar fee. Even when I send in hundreds and hundreds of them we still have that fee tacked on.. Haven't once seen my metrics change enough to remove that fee.  And I don't want to hear it from anybody 'oh send more inventory' 'oh well that's not Amazon's fault'  We've been selling on there for 7 years We have top selling products and we can't always get out a huge number of them to Amazon every couple weeks. We've never had to before. Just another way for them to tax us.
2024-10-27,"Have to agree, your points are totally valid. But I want to add that at least in Europe FBM option is getting more and more popular again as it's cheaper than Amazon's FBA, especially if you ship from eastern/central EU countries.

At least this is something that we see with our clients. The return of FBM popularity is simply based on the FBA charges.
It's not easy because of all the Amazon's KPI's but still manageable also on a large scale."
2024-10-27,"I feel your pain, especially on numbers 1 & 3. I actually wrote an article recently about those. To me, they‚Äôre both essentially the same because number 3 is just another cost that eats away margins. Many sellers don‚Äôt know how to factor returns into their costs, which is why so many inaccurately project their margins.

Since I got started in 2018, these same issues have been present and have only become more challenging. I tell people all the time that selling on Amazon has become exponentially more technical to succeed (meaning that you have to run it like a business, requires in-depth knowledge to manage successfully over the long term, etc). 

The thing to remember is there are 3 parties that Amazon has to consider: the customers, the sellers and their shareholders. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt make all 3 happy and the most dispensable party is the seller."
2024-10-27,Jeff Bezos did say that your profit margin is my opportunity - so let's not act surprised.  I am actively building my business off marketplaces - trying to cultivate a proper and engaged community.  Long term strategy but it takes effort.  Amazon will reign supreme but always have an omnichannel approach. Build out B2B as well!
2024-10-27,"3. Create a case for each return and provide pictures: LPN, return slip, product for the refund. May be a lot of work depending on your volume. We only return back a small percentage of our products but we were able to be reimbursed within a chat conversation inside of 5 minutes on our last one. I was blown away but may we got lucky the once as normally getting reimbursed from Amazon is harder than launching a spacecraft into orbit."
2024-10-29,"Haha, I was lucky enough to have already worked shit jobs before I got hired at amazon. The biggest culture shock for me was instant approval of PTO, and the ability to leave when never I needed.

People don‚Äôt realize that almost every other job would fire you for leaving without advance notice and I‚Äôm talking a week in advance and then you‚Äôd have to pray they accepted it. I‚Äôve had to skip doctors appointments because they refused to let me have the day off. I‚Äôve had to go into work sick, there was no DLS type system to get the day off, you either went in or had to use time off, if you didn‚Äôt have sick time you just got fired instead.

Amazon spoils the shit out of you. I can never go back to working Walmart or retail ever again. I couldn‚Äôt do it."
2024-10-29,Yeah people love to complain about Amazon until they leave.
2024-10-29,"Exactly this. I didn‚Äôt have to leave Amazon to figure this out. I ended up at Amazon because I needed a job yesterday. The job market is tough and demoralizing. Compared to my past jobs, Amazon is a piece of cake, and the pay is decent for what it is. If you make friends with the right people and know what path you want to move up within Amazon, you can make it happen while taking advantage of career choice. Just gotta apply yourself. Or if you don‚Äôt want to move up and stay a T1 forever, that‚Äôs fine, too. Nothing wrong with that. Just get your money and benefits."
2024-10-29,"I‚Äôve been in and out of production/logistics for a LONG long time. Amazon is by far the easiest, most organized and flexible job I‚Äôve ever had. Mentally draining?  Sometimes. But that‚Äôs gunna be any job. Any. I worked at a production plant prior to Amazon for four years and it gave new meaning to grind. You down. Into the dirt. But here‚Äôs a pizza party and a sweatshirt!  Yay!!  They all do that. Amazon is 1/10 the physical work and stress."
2024-10-29,"Same. I left Amazon office last November and I HATE it. I thought coming to another office would be so much better because it‚Äôs a smaller, ‚Äúfamily‚Äù company. WRONG. There‚Äôs no HR here, I have about 1 month of PTO saved up because we can never use it, don‚Äôt get breaks at all (im in AZ, so it‚Äôs not illegal for an employer to not give you a break) and I‚Äôm miserable. BUT, after months of applying at Amazon I finally got my old job back, the pay is a little more than what I made last time and it‚Äôs $1 more than what I make right now. I‚Äôll take it. Even if it‚Äôs my old job, I seriously don‚Äôt care. I have such shitty health insurance at this current job, I haven‚Äôt gone to therapy in months because of how expensive it is and how shitty my insurance is. The benefits at Amazon are so good, a lot of people complain about the job until you leave and realize that no one else has benefits as good as them. And, work life balance. I HATE working 9-5 Mon-Fri. Give me back my 10 4‚Äôs so I can have a 3 day weekend again, I don‚Äôt even care if it‚Äôs overnight!ü•≤"
2024-10-29,"It's mostly on management no matter where you go. I thrived and was happy working factory until management changed. same went with the FC, but I stuck it out thinking the next manager would be better, but it just got worse and worse.

2024-10-30,"Good luck. One of my top selling products was flagged as needing UL listing even though there is not even a UL testing standard. It is a name brand product from a large company and it does not offer any kind of requirements for testing because it is not a dangerous product. 

I moved around $270k worth of of these units a month on Amazon and I gave up the fight. I eventually recalled all of the products. 

As of right now (9 months later) you cannot find the name brand version of this product on Amazon, however you can find the cheap chinese knockoff version which is getting a ton of sales and 3.2 stars (my listing was 4.9) 

Amazon has turned into complete aids."
2024-10-30,I would post on the Amazon forums and tag the associates there with your ticket number. May need 3rd part testing to prove your product doesn't contain it?
2024-10-30,"Yes, a bot triggered the claim, maybe via a competitor or maybe just by mistake as someone said. But you are also dealing with a bot trying to help your case. These amazon support guys just try to let the bots do the work, but you need to talk to a real person. I dont know if you gotta say slightly stronger wording in your messages or what could trigger a human looking at your case, but you have to brighten up... to see."

2024-10-31,The margin expansion is pretty amazing for the company of Amazon‚Äôs size. The huge spending in 2020-2022 which made the EPS trash during high inflation seem to be paying off. This looks to be going above $200 again.

2024-10-31,"Amazon regards their workers like cattle to the slaughter.

2024-11-07,"I've been at Amazon for 4.5 years. It is far from the worst job I've worked. I've worked with lazier coworkers and their laziness always increased MY workload. At Amazon, another person being lazy really doesn't affect me. I'm responsible for my own work and that's it. Yeah, some managers suck at doing their job but I've worked under much more incompetent and blatantly shitty and horrible managers who treated me like trash. Here, my managers pretty much just leave me alone. I do my job so they have no reason to bother me. There are several managers I've never met who are in my management history but most of them I have met. Most weren't awful to work under cause like I said, they've mostly just let me do my thing. I have a good rapport with my PAs. HR is hit or miss but for the most part, I haven't had issues. I've taken plenty of PLOAs, 1 or 2-day medical leave, and FMLA with short-term disability. When I've had schedule issues, HR is mostly helpful. 

I've worked plenty of jobs that were far more toxic and terrible for my mental health, for far less money, and with no benefits or complete shit benefits that weren't worth paying for. As someone with only a high-school diploma, Amazon is a pretty cushy job. Pays well, has lots of benefits that are affordable for me AND my husband, good time off options, good schedules, and relatively low stress. 

Honestly, it's probably my number 2 spot for jobs worked. My number 1 job wasn't sustainable in terms of pay or benefits. I can't even afford to wait 30-90 days most jobs require before eligibility for benefits. So no point in leaving a job I'm content with. For $24.80/hr, I'm good. 

It may not be for everyone but it's also really not that bad of a place. 

Idc about anyone's criminal history. That's their business, not mine. If someone wants to work while drunk or high, that's also not my business. That's outside of my pay grade to worry about. I'm just a tier 1 so I'm gonna let the L4s deal with that. If they don't, oh well. Not my circus, not my monkeys."
2024-11-07,"Sorry that your FC sucks but this isn't the culture AT ALL at the Amazon XL I work at. I would say at least half of the people at my FC have been there since we opened in Nov '22 (or a couple months after, incl myself) As long as you're doing your job, it's practically impossible to have issues with TOT or rate. As someone that has worked in the corporate world as well, I can tell you there are always people that come to work high or having consumed alcohol. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It IS an individual issue because unless Amazon is going to give breathalyzers at the door every day, that's not something they can mitigate. But for almost $24/hr with practically unlimited time off and amazing benefits, I don't see myself leaving literally ever. Iono, maybe I lucked out but I definitely don't have any of these issues that you listed"
2024-11-07,"Amazon is so easy! Sometimes I‚Äôm counting pods in disbelief they pay me $20/Hr to do this.
I never bring the job home and on my days off I never have to go in or take a call from someone at work. When people don‚Äôt show up to their shift it doesn‚Äôt affect me at all.

2024-11-07,"Amazon is just a stepping stone for a lot of us. For me, Amazon is the best place I‚Äôve worked. Every job has its pro and cons and that goes for amazon as well.

I‚Äôm personally sticking around until I get my degree from the CCP and I‚Äôm outtie"
2024-11-07,"I spent six years at Amazon, working in various roles like a PA, Learning Trainer, and Driver Trainer. In my experience, Amazon stands out as one of the best warehouse environments to work in. The structure, organization, and overall work culture there really set it apart. I eventually left for a Shipping Manager position at another company, but that ended up being one of my worst experiences. It made me realize that many (though not all) warehouses outside of Amazon lack the same level of organization and are often much less structured. As long as you are not worried about what others are doing and just focus on what needs to be done by you, you have nothing to worry about."

If you're doing anything in that niche you're definitely going to want to have separate accounts owned by different LLCs and you'll want to have all your paperwork in order.

No one knows how this will play out, but a lot of people thought the same thing with Shopify. Amazon lost that battle and Shopify dominates that market. It really comes down to execution and understanding customers. If I were a consumer of these products, I would definitely want a separate platform for these types of purchases."
2024-11-14,"well, finances and guidance still looking good imo, I can still see it grow, despite amazon entering the market"
2024-11-15,"After that drop. Probably. Risk priced in. Besides amazon is a competitor. Nothing new to have competition. Also not everyone is a penny pincher that cost is always the factor. HIMS already has established subscriptions and can always improve price structure. Nothing new with new competitions entering the fray. Whole reason for the drop to begin with. Pricing that in. Earnings would still be good and like Amazon‚Äôs logistics, it takes awhile and doesn‚Äôt truly dominate persay."
2024-11-15,Amazon has been competing with Hims for years and Hims keeps growing 70% per year. Idk why these recycled announcements have any impact.
2024-11-14,"Did Walmart, ebay, Etsy, etc ran out of business because Amazon said they will enter their market? Don't be a sheep and use that opportunity."
2024-11-14,"Most Amazon shoppers will not go past the first page of results - and so if you are surfacing the product to them on the top row and it's a good product, they will click it there and purchase it. 

  
The goal is to get your products on the first page organically, so you are not paying for your sales through ads. Many people focus on ROAS, but you should really be looking at Total ROAS when you are measuring your advertising efficiency. 

  
It takes time, careful planning, and the right approach to have your products ranking on the front page organically on multiple keywords, but it can be done. My advice is to focus on a few high-volume and a few mid-volume to start, see how you progress, and go from there."
2024-11-15,"What everyone else said.

And talk to an Amazon expert to ensure your detail pages are fully optimized on Amazon for organic search and ranking.

Consider Amazon ads as well."
2024-11-15,i mean on amazon
2024-11-17,"I worked as an online business broker for 4 years, and now work for one of the largest Amazon software providers. I‚Äôve seen a lot of hugely profitable businesses, and many failed attempts. 

Amazon has changed a lot over the last few years. 5+ years ago it was easier to make money - there wasn‚Äôt as much competition and Amazon fees were lower. 

Now, it‚Äôs extremely competitive. Even products that are fabulously branded, well priced with excellent reviews might make minimal profit. 

Chinese competitors are willing to sell at a loss to stomp out other sellers. 

BUT many people still do make money. It‚Äôs a combination of branding, product and reviews PLUS luck. 

I am referring to private label products."
2024-11-18,"I worked managing an FBA Amazon account for someone. He created products that only he sold so he governed the price and there was no competition. After 7 years, he reached 2 million/year in profit. He obviously sold a lot of stuff and a lot of the products he had to pay royalties on to other brands (won't mention who) but yes, a lot went into it. We got a lot of shipments in from China and we'd then ship to FBA's as our own brand."
2024-11-17,"I've had a completely ungated account for 20 years. It's very difficult to make serious money on Amazon. When Amazon notices velocity they will swoop in, backdoor you, and become you competition.

You need to develop your own website and circumvent business to your direct website."
2024-11-18,"Create your own website and drive traffic to it using social media.  It's honestly not worth the hassle using Amazon long term, when you can have complete control using your own site."
2024-11-18,Are your upc codes on your website listing detail pages? If so try removing them as their bots may be using them to compare to Amazon. Maybe also change images as I bet they‚Äôre using AI to match your website listings to their Amazon listings.
2024-11-18,you lose buy box because your price on amazon is higher than your website?
2024-11-19,"Edit: HappyKapow and I have a strong overlap of things we use AI for, so I rearranged my list for use cases that we share vs not and why:

Yes/same:

* 1. Seller Support
* 2. Listing optimization
* 3. Translation
* 4. Feedback analysis to fix issues -- we mainly do it for our own feedback, not competitors... that's actually a great idea from his team.
* 6. KW/ad optimization
* 7. CSRs

No/diff:

* 5. Data and marketing strategies - our current team/process significantly outperforms the AI + the AI hallucinates too much for our liking.
* 8. FBA reimbursements - we have template responses at this point + processes already + we do a lot less of this now with the new reimbursement process.
* 9. Visual content ideation  - no mainly because we have trusted outside design contractor partners instead of in-house.  This is something we're weak on and NOT pushing the envelope.

Us/new:

* 10. Project management helper - we have AI notetakers for all our internal/external meetings that then generate tasks, and we have AI integrated in our team chats to coordinate status/progress.  \~5% hallucination but works great otherwise.
* 11. Account management KPI helper - we created some custom GPTs that takes data from Amazon (reports + brand APIs), then tells us how we're doing period/period + relative to others in the niche.  Hallucinates \~5% as well incredibly helpful for our account managers who are typically good generalists but not strong analysts.
* 12. Analyst helper - we created some custom GPTs that replace our existing feed/file analyzers to help manage listing price and identify possible issues.  Hallucinates \~25% of the time so we still do most of the grunt work ourselves.

High level thoughts from the biz: The dream is an automated company that just does everything by itself; not there any time soon, fortunately for us meatbags.  Strategically we're trying to build/train custom GPTs to support specialists on the team, instead of just using the general GPT as tooling."
2024-11-19,"We use Chatgpt extensively at our agency to streamline various Amazon work. While product titles and descriptions are a great starting point, there are a lot of other ways it can make life easier for sellers. Here are some examples based on what‚Äôs worked for us:

**1. Seller Support and Case Management**

* AI is a lifesaver for dealing with Seller Support! I use Chatgpt to draft clear, concise responses for opening or escalating cases, creating Plans of Action (POA), and appeals.
* I‚Äôll often use Chatgpt's voice feature to talk through the issue and let it refine my response. It‚Äôs great for organizing my thoughts, making replies professional (especially when frustrated with inexperienced agents), and even venting without burning bridges.
* Keeping a single thread for each issue is a game-changer. *Example*: If an appeal gets rejected, I paste the rejection into the same thread, add call notes with Account Health, and get a polished new draft ready. Saves so much time and mental energy.

**2. Listing Optimization Beyond Basics**

* Chatgpt helps us refine bullet points and A+ Content to be keyword-rich, conversion-focused, and on-brand. It‚Äôs also great for testing different tones and styles.

**3. Translation with Context**

* Like you, we‚Äôve found AI-powered translations (customized with product details) to be way better than Amazon‚Äôs auto-translations, especially when tone or cultural nuances matter.

**4. Competitor Analysis**

* Summarizing competitor reviews to uncover common pain points or unmet needs, which inform product improvements and marketing strategies.

**5. Data and Marketing Strategies**

* AI is like a virtual marketing assistant. I share campaign performance data and brainstorm strategies in real-time, or use it to evaluate data and plan next steps. It‚Äôs great for iterating on ideas and staying organized.

**6. PPC Ad Copy and Keyword Research**

* Generating keyword-rich ad copy and testing variations for Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, and Display ads. Helps maintain balance between keyword density and readability.

**7. Customer Support Automation**

* Templates for common customer inquiries ensure timely, professional responses that are consistent across the board.

**8. FBA Reimbursements**

* Pairing AI with analytics tools to identify errors (lost inventory, overcharges) and draft compelling cases for reimbursements.

**9. Visual Content Ideation**

* While AI visuals aren‚Äôt quite there yet, it‚Äôs useful for concept mockups or brainstorming creative themes for lifestyle photos and videos.

Honestly, chatgpt has been a game-changer for keeping things organized, especially with the ability to save threads and come back to them with updates. It‚Äôs super helpful for tracking everything in one Amazon account, but it really shines when you‚Äôre juggling multiple accounts, marketplaces, platforms, brands, or goals. It helps cut through the chaos and keeps everything in one place."
2024-11-20,"While I can't speak for amazon search results, we are absolutely destroying our competition on the real search engines with a full time in house SEO employee. 

Google is starting to get much better at filtering out AI SEO."
2024-11-20,"Amazon is strict on brand protection. If Brand X has a list of authorized resellers such as Walmart... buying from Walmart does not make you an authorized seller on Amazon. You would actually have to be on Brand X's list of authorized resellers and have that submitted to Amazon as proof.

Amazon has this in place to protect the brand. It's better that way otherwise the ASIN would be flooded with resellers whether the product was authentic or not; especially China sellers.

I would've deleted the listing that was flagged. Sell it on a different platform and move on. You can only have 1 Amazon account; it's not worth the loss of the account."
2024-11-20,"There‚Äôs a binding arbitration clause in the seller central terms of service. Also, just because Walmart is an authorized distributor of the product does not mean you are. Just like you can‚Äôt buy liquor at a liquor store and then become a liquor distributor.

Take a free consult with any of the Amazon lawyers and see if you still have a leg to stand on. I would presume not."
2024-11-20,Seems like Amazon is deactivating a lot of seller accounts lately. Things are getting bad. The way  things are you need a letter of authorisation from a brand to sell it on Amazon. Buying from a distributor and putting it on Amazon ain‚Äôt gonna work anymore without permission to sell. Hearing this week some sellers getting regated from brands who do not want them selling on Amazon and now stuck with products in Amazon fulfillment centers.
2024-11-21,"I have been selling on Amazon since 2010. Built an 8 figure business.  We are a brand importing and selling our products.  There is a distinction I believe that is being ignored. 
Buying retail and reselling on amazon in not permitted.  The logic of buying products at Marshall‚Äôs and other discounters was popular years ago. 
Of course the retails (Walmart) is authorized to sell the product.  The issue is very the seller must be authorized.  
As a seller even if you purchase from an authorized wholesaler or distributor that is not enough.  That wholesaler/distributor has to have the authority to resale without restriction to sales channels.  
We sell wholesale from time to time. Our terms preclude the wholesaler from selling on Amazon directly or indirectly. 
I have take more than one seller off amazon over the years. 
As the brand owner if we do not approve the seller they cannot sell our products/brand.  
It‚Äôs the brand owner on Amazon that must approve the seller.  
Walmart cannot approve you to sell on Amazon for a branded product."
2024-11-21,"I‚Äôm only new on FBA but used to study law. My only thing to say is don‚Äôt get your legal advice off of Reddit. I‚Äôm seeing comments like ‚ÄòAmazon have no duty to you‚Äô which is blatantly incorrect. You‚Äôll have entered into a range of contractual relationships with Amazon, with a range of implicit and explicit terms to those relationships.

Just speaking on that aspect of the issue, I‚Äôd consult an attorney to find out where you actually stand. Or if you want someone to informally tell you, make sure they actually have a background which means their legal advice is credible."
2024-11-20,"You can‚Äôt sue Amazon. You can only go through arbitration. As with many things involving lawyers, unless you‚Äôve got money to burn, you‚Äôre SOL."
2024-11-21,"Amazon should bring tier 2 positions back, for PIT, TDR, Amnesty etc. Lots of potential liabilities come with those positions, and associates should be compensated for them."
2024-11-21,"Idk why it went over so many heads..

Your site saw the teamsters were giving out tacos so they tried to win back the associate's trust by ""one upping"" the teamsters giving y'all chik fil a. That shit is funny they went back and forth like that. 

When they had the meeting at our site, the biggest thing HR was saying was is ""remember guys, Unions are a business. They only want you to join to take your money. If you get a pay raise it won't make a difference when you have to pay union dues"". Pretty ironic considering Amazon is a business that only cares about money and metrics. Your ass is grass if you're having an off day rate wise or coming back from break 1 minute late. 

With a union you get your full 15 minute break. That break starts when you enter the break room and ends exactly 15 minutes later. Not 15 minutes from the last scanned item."
2024-11-21,"I will never understand people who have a genuine loyalty to Amazon. Like you know Daddy Bezos is never gonna see you or your effort? Don't get me wrong, I put in the work at work. I'm paid to do a job so I do it and I do it well so i can earn thay paycheck. But I don't ever have any delusions that Amazon gives a shit about me lol. If another company approaches me with a job offer that includes better pay and benefits then I'm jumping ship immediately."
2024-11-21,"This is just Amazon listing your inventory in other marketplaces and selling. They take care of all export/import duties and that is completely invisible to you. 

You will notice that Amazon pays your price anyway and often you do not get returns. So win-win.

No conspiracy theory involved!"
2024-11-22,Be really careful. Amazon will send its own sales to you.  Sounds great until you find out that they only send you remote deliveries with high shipping fees.
2024-11-21,What other marketplaces could they be? Are you referring to like Canada/Mexico/Europe Amazon marketplaces or something entirely different?
2024-11-23,"Yes, similar situation as yours back in June. 2 boxes at 83 pounds of product just quietly closed the shipment with no discrepancies. Had to provide the same 3-4 invoices multiple times, they kept with same old copy paste BS closing cases and I would reopen. Went on for 3 weeks and my patience in my replies for reimbursement wore thin, even a bit pissy in fact. Finally was reimbursed, a bit less than my estimates, then over a 1 week period many got reversed as my inventory was ‚Äúfound‚Äù. Absolute thievery happening. Like anyone is really shipping in empty boxes. Just keep pounding away at them, reply at different times of the day so it‚Äôs a different shift in whatever 3rd world country Amazon has contracted to screw over their sellers."
2024-11-23,"Something similar happened to me. I sent in $64k worth of oil filters. Once checked in they froze my account and made me do an interview (2 month wait) where they requested all the invoices for all my inventory. After 2 weeks they said my invoice wasn‚Äôt sufficient and needed more documents. After 4 months of back and forth waiting 2 weeks between each email they ‚Äúdisposed of‚Äù my inventory and put me out of business. Very common right now not saying it‚Äôll happen to you or everyone. But alot of people rn in the business are experiencing legitimate invoices not being sufficient. My aunt cuts hair for someone high up at Amazon and after telling her my story she said that Amazon is really only wanting brands to sell their own product so they‚Äôre getting rid of a lot of 3rd party sellers.

Demanded arbitration hoping for a settlement and essentially told to go f myself by Amazon lawyers.

Edit for clarification: The wholesaler I used for that product always worked for ungating and a lost inventory insurance claim. UPS lost my inventory and Amazon payed me 20k for that after 6 months of ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù so the wholesaler was legit. Just suddenly not as if 2024 when they started shutting accounts down"
2024-11-25,"It's frustrating, but on the flip side, it motivated me to get shopify up and running as well as get on walmart.  Next step-applying to Target for when that is up and running.  Writings on the wall - Amazon is always going to be the biggest marketplace and the first place to sell, but they're not going to stop squeezing.  When they show you they'll never stop increasing the fee's, you best believe them. ;)"
2024-11-26,"I would be fantastic if they would stop price fixing, and then there would be some check on fees. While there is some competition, they are still the whale in a fish bowl. 

We could easily undercut the price of our products on Amazon by 30% on Shopify and still make more money. 

I feel like Lina Khan was our only hope but come inauguration day she will likely be gone."
2024-11-26,"Well thanks goodness for that! My 30% take wouldn't be able to sustain that - you know what's funny is that within a few years, sellers will need to raise their prices by double, not take any profit at all, or quit Amazon altogether.  But these articles will keep coming out like propaganda.. ""There's no problems here, the only problem is you!"""
2024-11-25,"Amazon hates Unions because it takes away some of their power. It‚Äôs not even all about pay, they just don‚Äôt want to give up their absolute control over you while on the clock."
2024-11-25,but why is Amazon worried about the union something amazon is scared of us to find out!!!
2024-11-25,"They just gave reasons to sign . I've belonged to 3 unions In my life and never,ever have I heard of union brothers coming to your home unannounced . That's what union meetings are for. Dues are a small fee for increased pay and better working conditions.  Damn amazon ,do better than lies . That's why workers need unions"
2024-11-25,"My brother who is in a union once told me this story. I think it would make a great response to this propaganda. I will change the story a little so it applies to Amazon. Fictional story but hopefully you will get the point.

A Regional Manager visits a site one day. He approaches a young man who had just finished their 10 hour shift of MET. He says to the young man, ‚Äú you see that brand new Porsche parked over there? If you come in on time everyday and work hard everyday, by this time next year, I will have two of those.‚Äù 

Not trying to be facetious. It‚Äôs an allegory. BTW. My brother owns a house and has great benefits."
2024-11-27,"Honestly. I'm divorced and can't upvote this enough. Marriage isn't in trouble cause women are choosing to be single. Men are just realizing how expensive women are. For literally no reason. 

My ex would have an amazon delivery every single day and spend hundreds at Target per week. Just insane."
2024-11-28,"Amazon used back door connections to the DOJ to ""indict"" me which takes zero talent. Once indicted you have zero due process in a case like this. This is not justice, this is corrupt lawafare. If you are ok with that then move on. Many are not"
2024-12-01,With account score more than 250 Amazon support has to call you before deactivate your account to resolve the issue. This is the main benefit to hold Amazon Health score 250 or above

2024-12-01,"Amazon attribution tracking ? I think it‚Äôs relatively new and still in beta. 

You can generate unique URLs for your products under Amazon ads -> measurement and reporting -> Amazon attribution . Then you can see clicks, orders, conversion etc for each url."
2024-12-01,I‚Äôm confused‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt you know your sales from the URL you use to advertise your product?  Doesn‚Äôt Amazon give you a credit since you are bringing outside traffic to Amazon?
2024-12-01,Let me clarify. My Google Ads Campaign is designed to send traffic to my website (Shopify store - Landing Page). I have UTMs and I can see engagement and sometimes add to cart but few checkouts. The store at Amazon has its own ads inside Amazon Marketplace. I want to know if is it possible to track conversions happening on Amazon derived from my Shopify Google Ads Campaign .
2024-12-04,"The problem isn‚Äôt really Amazon. It‚Äôs every big corporation. Their goal is to maximize our productivity while paying as little as possible.

We are still here because we need money to live. Amazon isn‚Äôt the worst employer in many cities, but they can still do better. If no one complained, our pay would likely be minimum wage."
2024-12-04,"It's Amazon bro, you answered your own question"
2024-12-04,So because we‚Äôre hired by Amazon we aren‚Äôt allowed to complain or write negative stuff about them? That sounds like an easy way to get completely taken advantage of from everyone‚Ä¶.
2024-12-04,I work at Amazon because I like to complain about it on Reddit and people like you always make my day
2024-12-04,Who‚Äôs the bigger dirt bag here? Amazon for taking the money. Or the lawyer suing because Amazon won‚Äôt send its underpaid workers into harms way to deliver someone‚Äôs socks fast enough. Jesus wept.
2024-12-04,Imagine actually policing these areas instead of suing Amazon for not being willing to get robbed.
2024-12-04,"I lived in DC in a ""nice"" neighborhood that is much safer than these. Carjacking is extremely common. Package theft is extremely common.   

I personally witnessed 4 carjackings on 3 years. If you're an Amazon driver there it's HIGHLY likely you'd get held up at gunpoint. Not that DC government cares. They just let a guy go without bail who was on camera spraying AK47 fire in a neighborhood at people. Yep. That happened. Recently."
2024-12-04,Amazon should just tell the people 2 day shipping is often not available in those zip codes. Just a warning that comes across when they subscribe. Easy fix.
2024-12-04,Amazon should counter sue stating that DC has failed Ward 7 and 8 residents by not providing basic safety policing to ensure companies like Amazon and their workers feel safe to deliver packages.
2024-12-05,"It‚Äôs funny because I had to restock and I decided to do half the shipment with AWD and the other half was sent to FBA using Amazon Global Logistics (AGL) and it‚Äôs my AGL shipment that had been delayed for months. It‚Äôs been at LGB8 for 5 weeks but hasn‚Äôt been checked in yet. 

Meanwhile my AWD shipment was shipped later and was checked in no problems. Either way, there logistics is unpredictable and needs to change. What bothers me the most is that they require a 2 week window for your deliveries, but they can‚Äôt even provide a proper check in times. All of these things are just reminders for all of us to try to diversify off of Amazon."
2024-12-05,Both. Sellers bear the costs of mess they created and Amazon assume that we can‚Äôt leave them so why bother fixing it.
2024-12-04,"Amazon has been sending emails since before September asking brand owners sellers and vendors to prepare for holiday season by shipping inventory months before hand

Did you not get these emails?

I suspect they even stop sell-in at some point in the peak season and only do sell-out"
2024-12-04,This will probably be like Domino's and there will be some sheepish announcement in three years where they talk about corrective actions but Amazon still won't deliver there due to crime.
2024-12-04,"""The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has ‚Äúsecretly excluded‚Äù two ‚Äúhistorically underserved‚Äù D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price."" ...

"" ‚ÄúWhile Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.‚Äù"" ...

""In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries...""

""Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%."" ...

""The ZIP codes in Schwalb‚Äôs complaint are in areas with large Black populations..."""
2024-12-04,Much of rural America is also only served by UPS and USPS delivery for Amazon packages--for example in the small town where I live. It's simply an economic decision and has nothing to do with racism. And again people there pay exactly the same Prime subscription fees and may get slower delivery.
2024-12-04,"Let‚Äôs blame the company who wont deliver to the crime ridden neighborhoods instead of doing something about the crime..

Amazon is nobody‚Äôs friend but what a waste of taxpayer resources with this lawsuit. 

When I worked at Pizza Hut in high school, we had entire blocks crossed off the map because it was too dangerous. If a driver got robbed, that street was forever banned for delivery, which seems perfectly reasonable to me."
2024-12-04,"I've worked with leaders from UPS, DHL, and FedEx- they all said Amazon was a complete palace compared to their old warehouses.

Everyone loves to talk about the UPS drivers, the UPS drivers with their insane pay scales and always glosses over the part time warehouse workers."
2024-12-04,"Amazon is the easiest job ever. Full stop. Anyone that thinks this job is remotely hard has never had a job in any other warehouse/factory setting. Amazon bends over backwards for its employees and let us get away with so much shit. That‚Äôs why I laugh when I see these people fail out and they say they are going to Chewey, UPS, FedEx, and then within the month they are back saying how the other places are worse. The only thing that makes Amazon hard to work for is the Management team. If the FCs were run better it wouldn‚Äôt be such an issue. They have slowly but surely over the last decade whittle away at the good managers and now we have what is left."
2024-12-04,"Worked all 3. FedEx was the worst of the three. Their linehaul work is brutal and warehouses are something from a 80s movie. UPS was cool cause of the union but the work wasn‚Äôt consistent and you could be sent home early which is why I left. Amazon is easily the best with accommodations, upt, pro, LOA, and safety . IMO"
2024-12-04,I came from FedEx almost fainted in just 2 weeks of being there. Now I work at Amazon FC it‚Äôs like a vacation in comparison. Besides the managers coming to your station every Friday of your shift telling you that you suck work harder meet demands  but also good job at the same time.
2024-12-04,"It's completely dependent on site and management/ community at that site, Amazon ups, or FedEx, don't matter. Your going to see random horror story's from all. If you don't like it you are free to move between buildings and companies l."
2024-12-04,I worked at Fedex and Amazon warehouse. At amazon I dont lift over 20 pounds. Heaviest is probably cat litter thats like 20 pounds. Most items are like 1 pound or less. Amazon is definitely easier for me.
2024-12-04,That's exactly why I chose Amazon if I had to do warehouse work. Fuck doing way too much for this society.
2024-12-04,"I worked for all 3 of them. Amazon is a piece of cake compared to the others. UPS has heavier boxes with only a 10 min break, and you only get so many hours as a seasonal. FedEx didn‚Äôt even allow me to have a phone in the facility, and their warehouse seems outdated asf. Came back to Amazon when I realized they gave more hours, have multiple breaks, more time off options, & I wasn‚Äôt lifting boxes heavier than 50 pounds."
2024-12-04,"Compared to FedEx ground, Amazon (sort center specifically) is insanely easy."
2024-12-06,"From the article:  
*""""In the ZIP codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages,"" Nantel said. ""We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.""""*

Makes sense."
2024-12-05,"Yes, Amazon reimburses sellers if an FBA shipment is lost, especially if the shipping label was purchased through Amazon. Here's what to do:

1. **Wait Period**: Amazon requires a waiting period (usually 30-60 days) before investigating lost shipments.
2. **File a Claim**: Once the wait period is over, file a claim in Seller Central under **Inventory Reimbursement Requests**.
3. **Reimbursement**: Amazon typically reimburses the cost of goods based on your supplier invoices or product value.

Keep tracking the shipment, and set a reminder to open a claim once the waiting period ends."
2024-12-05,"If Amazon can't find the package, they usually reimburse for lost FBA shipments since you used their label. You'll just have to wait until they can start the investigation next month."
2024-12-05,"If you shipped it from your office using an Amazon paid label I usually ask the customer to open an A-to-Z claim, and Amazon will refund and you will. Your account will not be dinged."
2024-12-06,"The commission fees are refunded. The fulfillment fees are not. You have no choice but to accept it, or don't sell on Amazon."

No."
2024-12-06,Wait until amazon starts undercutting you with your returned items. That‚Äôs always fun!
2024-12-06,"Yep, we own the trademark for it. We're registered in brand registry and have tried filing violations. It works like 60% of the time to get their listings pulled down, but it's also a hassle to always order the product (hate that we have to even buy our own product), file the violation, go back and forth with amazon, etc. We've thought about going the lawyer route, but agree it's poking the beast. Plus, Amazon is just so big I'm not sure how far we'd get with it and this would be a financial commitment too."
2024-12-08,"Amazon‚Äôs FCF is absolutely insane. Jassy is gonna Tim Cook this company towards over a decade of 20%+ CAGR. I would not be surprised if they end up #1 in market cap. Also Trump said today he‚Äôs agreed to meet Bezos for dinner. Bezos will suck up to get on Trump‚Äôs good side which is good for the stock.

Biggest risks are tariffs hurting e-commerce and antitrust but Amazon is diversified and printing enough cash to weather most storms. I think the worst is behind Amazon after they overspent in 2020-21 and got hammered by inflation in 2022. 

AI will also help them in so many ways. Fatter margins due to lower headcount, AWS, ad business, etc etc."
2024-12-08,"That DealBook interview was very good. Bezos went into a lot of topics, including how he thinks Blue Origin may end up being a bigger business than Amazon. Andrew Ross Sorkin got him comfortable, which allowed Bezos to delve into his thought process and philosophies - well worth listening to."

2024-12-11,"I've had to do that because of a SKU mistake, but only on a fresh listing. Amazon support didn't suggest that, though. They suggested too bad, so sad."
2024-12-11,Amazon Support's go to is always delete for 24 hours and relist. It's like IT asking if you've tried turning your router on and back off again. It is however often HORRIBLE advice.
2024-12-11,"I've received the delete and relist instructions several times over the years. It was always because the moronic Amazon bot made a misleading change to the title or size. They said that they have to make a change on the backend to fix it. 

Most often it took 2-4 times before it worked so I lost considerable sales. However, I never had the additional issues that you described."

**Prompt for Appeal Creation:**

""Please help me draft a professional appeal for an Amazon suspension due to an inauthentic goods policy violation. The appeal should:

1. Briefly **acknowledge the issue** without explicitly admitting fault.
2. Emphasize a **Plan of Action (POA)** that focuses on organizational improvements and enhanced quality control.
3. Include details about **creating a dedicated department** or hiring a team to handle supplier compliance, inventory quality checks, and ongoing account monitoring.
4. Highlight steps like implementing new inventory control processes, training staff, and utilizing tools/software for tracking and verifying product authenticity."
2024-12-14,"The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to pictures of children: 

Definition of personal information:

COPPA defines ""personal information"" to include photos, videos, or audio files of a child. 

Parental consent:

Businesses must obtain parental consent before collecting, using, or sharing any media that contains a child's image or voice. 


Call a lawyer immediately.

Demand that not only are the listings in violation are removed, but also demand that the selling account in violation, it's known address, IP and associated accounts are permanently banned. 

Request proof that the violating seller has been permanently banned from the Amazon platform.

The penalty for violations of COPPA is up to $50,120 per violation. Meaning that every time this photo of your child served by Amazon to a customer - the penalty is $50k per instance. Refresh the page - that's $100k. Refresh it again, thats $150,000.

This is a major fuck up on the seller's part and Amazon is liable for every violation from the second after you have notified them.

Send a printed copy of the letter via certified mail to Amazon HQ with attn made to Legal Department.

At minimum Amazon should ban the seller and make it as difficult as possible for them to ever sell on Amazon ever again.

With the right attorney  - you might even end up getting a payday."
2024-12-14,"Just ignore them. If you have invoices showing the purchase of what your selling is legit, and not a parallel import, you will have no problem. Just some of the usual scum that try and manipulate Amazon policies to remove competition"
2024-12-14,Yes. Do a small test buy to experiment with BB share. One of our best listings is just us and Amazon where we get like 60% of the BB. But generally it‚Äôs not worth it to compete with them for obvious reasons.
2024-12-14,"I've competed with Amazon, they try the undercutting, and then eventually bail if they can't be profitable. 

They would rather make commission on the sale than lose money and not make a commission.

2024-12-16,I haaate amazon for hpw thry treat small sellers.  The fees are crazy and the platform is horrible to use.  The UI looks like its from the 1700s.  Im weeks away from just pulling everything off Amazon because its not worth the faff
2024-12-16,"Seller support is notorious for being useless, my only advice is you continue to bug them until you find someone who will eventually reactivate your first account. For a lot, that‚Äôs what has worked and it‚Äôs what most people in Amazon groups suggest."
2024-12-16,"But i guess the key thing is the reason for the return is that the shipment did not arrive in time, but that time has not passed?  Or can they simply select any reason for return and amazon just accept it?"
2024-12-16,For me (FBM) rising shipping costs are more discouraging than Amazon fees. Mainly because they never ever go down lol.
2024-12-16,Then why are you still on Amazon?  Build your own website so you can eliminate these higher costs.
2024-12-16,"Dump Amazon, create a brand and sell via your webshop. I make 7 figs/year in revenue with 21 business days policy. If you have a good product, people are willing to wait. You don't need fast delivery and high fees. Or combine FBM and webshop"

You are talking about becoming an Amazon vendor. 

Amazon will only purchase from Brand owners / manufacturers and in some cases very large distributors.

You're a long way from becoming an Amazon vendor."
2024-12-17,"Word of advice, anyone who is making videos sharing courses or groups to help you sell items on Amazon, is often a scam/sham. Do not fall for it.

Im somone who sells FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) on Amazon, where I fulfil the shipping when I receive an order as its better margins than FBA (Fullfilled by Amazon).

Essentially these ads give you the illusion of profit by showing you certain tools & apps to check the prices and potential profit margins they could make for selling on Amazon. It gives a breakdown of either FBM or FBA to see if its worthwhile.

These tools are just for information. ""Selling them to Amazon"" is not how this works.

Lets say you find a product for cheaper, and you want to sell them through amazon for a profit flip.  
You will need to register for Amazon, get approved (with correct identifications, tax documents) and then you can start selling.

But to sell certain products, you need to be ""approved"" to sell them if they are part of a brand, each brand will require different verifications and approvals for you to sell them.

Once approved to sell a product. You have the choice of FBM and FBA, FBM is a lot harder unless youre able to guarantee prime (NDD) delivery, which is EXPENSIVE. If going down the FBA, youre not ""selling to amazon"" - you essentially ship them to amazon (through an approved courier) then these will be stored (at a price) by amazon and you can control the pricing of these. Then when an order comes in, amazon will pack it and ship it (for a fee) for the customer.

Hopefully thats a good ""starter for 10""!"

After all the deductions:

* **Amazon fees** (15%)
* **Average shipping costs** (\~$7)
* **Supply costs** (\~$0.50)

You‚Äôre left with just **$1.85 profit**.

But the issues don‚Äôt stop there:

* Driving to the store or UPS adds more costs, often overlooked.
* Amazon charges your credit card or bank account for fees and shipping, while **holding your $11 sale for a month** in case of returns.
* If they find even **one policy violation**, your account could be suspended or closed, and **your money might be lost forever**. If you‚Äôre lucky, you may eventually get your funds back, but many sellers never do.

In the end, for small sellers, Amazon‚Äôs system can feel like a **scam**‚Äîa platform where the risk is high, profits are slim, and rules are enforced with little room for error.

2024-12-19,"Why not continue to sell it on Amazon, but put the marketing behind it? The infrastructure and reviews are already there."
2024-12-19,You have way better potential for increased revenue by dialing in and promoting Amazon.
2024-12-19,"Heard this on the Acquisitions Anonymous pod recently, but the legendary Bill D‚ÄôAlessandro referred to this as the hardest play to run. They were discussing an Amazon supplements business.

What makes a great Amazon business operation is the opposite of what makes a great Shopify operation. Amazon alchemy doesn‚Äôt really directly translate off platform.

Even if you can pull those reviews, still need to figure out how to get traffic. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible, just like learning to ride a bike again. 

Amazon has distribution, and it‚Äôs all about listing optimization, reviews and maybe subtle product differentiation. The attention is built in. 

Shopify stores are ALL about distribution. Pick your poison: paid ads, SEO, content marketing, affiliate marketing, influencer marketing‚Ä¶ basically getting attention from nothing."
2024-12-19,"I'll admit I don't know much about selling on amazon apart from being an affiliate many, many years ago but I'm shocked to hear so many people advising to stay on amazon where you're completely beholden to another company rather than building up your own assets and brand elsewhere.

There's no reason they can't stay on Amazon while also starting up a shopify store where they'll take more of the profits and not have to worry about Amazon shutting them down, pushing them down the rankings or selling a competing product themselves."
2024-12-19,"Start including a card physical card and referral code in your shipments directing new customers to your new Shopify site.  Like many had said, you can‚Äôt just ‚Äútransfer your credibility on Amazon to somewhere else - that‚Äôs why Amazon is Amazon and charges those fees.  But any decent marketer would recommend that you need to ‚Äúown‚Äù your customer list - mailings lists, address database etc. so you can market to them directly - assuming you are interested in growing your business.  Then start rewarding your customers for posting videos on socials and tagging your business.  Don‚Äôt worry about the fact that it‚Äôs super niche (‚Äúriches are in the niches‚Äù)."
2024-12-19,"it isn't exactly a 'transition'.  creating a website would be independent of Amazon. he would want to continue to sell on Amazon while creating a website to also sell the product.

consider it could take a long time to get organic traffic yet unless people Google the brand name.  in that case he should have a website nevertheless.  it would even lend credibility to the amazon listing.  but only if the website is done well.  if it is poor it could be a negative and hurt Amazon sales.

besides that it will take some advertising money.  if you advertise on Google Shopping it would be in direct competition to the Amazon listing so it would need to be priced appropriately.

you won't know if it will be successful or not unless you do it.  where do you expect traffic to the website to come from?"
2024-12-19,"You can use reviews app such as to pull reviews from Amazon to Shopify. We used the Rivyo app for one of our Amazon Clients. 

Once you start selling on Shopify, you can collect reviews using Klaviyo which is mainly an email marketing service provider.

If it's a super niche but practical products this needs to be highlighted on your home and product pages. Since it's super niche, there's got to be a lot of long-tail keyword opportunies, check the search volume those keywords bring a month and check what is ranking in the top 10 Serps (search results on Google, Bing, etc), outside of big retailers such as Amazon since he's already on there anyway.

He's going to have to create how to and tutorial guides regarding the product. 

First thing you should do, sit down with him and draw up a customer persona, then craft all content, marketing and website design targeting this persona."
2024-12-19,"There‚Äôs pros and cons - I just went though a Shopify vs Amazon experience and I‚Äôm still recovering üôà
Amazon will insist to have the best pricing - so you can‚Äôt have your Shopify store ‚Äúbe the best‚Äù price. Which doesn‚Äôt necessarily matter as long as you own the listing. Generally customers do price shop and not everyone wants to shop on Amazon but it‚Äôs hard to compete with free shipping / free returns. Operationally I agree with everyone that‚Äôs saying go deeper with Amazon - however I hate that it‚Äôs a wall and if they say your done your done, you have nothing. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don‚Äôt love it for brand building - but brand building also comes with a cost."
2024-12-19,"You don't own your customers on Amazon so it's not easy to make the transition.

The only thing you could do directly is include a flyer on your shipping packages and include the web address on your packing lists etc.

Also make sure you offer checkout by Amazon.  

Aside from that, you're literally starting a new business from scratch. Start at the beginning."
2024-12-19,"I used Amazon BuyShipping with Shipstation until Shipstation started added an extra monthly fee for using Amazon BuyShipping on top of charging an extra 0.08 per label.  So I downgraded my Shipstation account to the lowest tier so I could still use the other features but now I generate all of my BuyShipping labels directly from Amazon SellerCentral and send them directly to my printer using QZ Tray.

I occasionally use Veeqo but I agree that the software is rough to look at."
2024-12-18,"I'm a much smaller business so I might not be in the same boat as you but most of this year it has been worth it for me, but the last 2 shipments I sent in, in November and December are taking forever to process.

2024-12-18,"Also last time I let Amazon handle costumer support they refunded everyone and their mothers, all people have to do is say item is damaged or blemished and Amazon costumer support will refund them no questions asked, does this happen a lot with fba?"
2024-12-19,"We had about 95% of our products FBA. They would occasionally lose stuff. And not just one or two here and there, but a whole pallet of maybe 20 large items that we sold for $400/each. Took months and months and months, and they still only found a few. We have proof they arrived properly but Amazon has no idea where they went and, unless we lawyer up and thereby destroy our selling relationship with them, there‚Äôs nothing we can do. If you want to sell on Amazon, basically whatever they say goes."
2024-12-19,"FBM just buy labels through Amazon and mark those settings for OTR delivery insurance. Metric problem solved. Mine went down sub 90 now that I marked that it‚Äôs at a perfect 100% no issues. 

Fba much more expensive for warehousing, loosing product etc. I don‚Äôt use it anymore at all."
2024-12-19,At least on eBay you can put something on the table so you don't mix them up. Would be easy for Amazon to implement the title of the listing on the label. I like the idea. Save me some paper.

2024-12-19,"You should be operating under one selling account. If you open a 2nd selling account, you need it to be registered under a 2nd business.

It's simple enough to add a brand to an existing selling account - hence no need to open a second selling account.

The only thing I can't speak on is you being in 2 different countries. But this is my understanding of the situation  - amazon doesn't want to see you with multiple selling accounts for 1 entity, as it is against their terms of service. But you can open a 2nd for a ""legitimate business purpose"", such as a brand new business (a 2nd entity).

You will need to appeal by admitting your mistake and prepping a plan of action to prevent you from doing this again, and maybe they will reinstate. Beyond that, there are services that will also do this for you and the pros are good at it. I would seek them out."
2024-12-19,"Don‚Äôt lose hope. If possible, start the appeal process again. It seems like the agent handling your case may have had a bias or a misunderstanding. Also, keep in mind that Amazon cannot rely solely on a verbal explanation for why you had to open two accounts. From their perspective, anyone could make a similar claim, and they‚Äôd have no way to verify it.

This is similar to Amazon's policy on seller complaints. Sellers aren't allowed to report competitors for reasons that don't align with Amazon's guidelines. If they did, every seller would be constantly filing complaints against their competitors to gain an edge.

I had a similar experience with a client whose account was closed because Amazon linked it to an account the business owner had created back in high school. It took several appeals and about 10 different versions of a Plan of Action, but eventually, the account was reinstated.

Stay persistent and refine your approach with each appeal. It‚Äôs a tough process, but it‚Äôs possible to succeed."
2024-12-19,"Why did you not take legal action against a person unlawfully enriching themselves with your brand? 

Also, if your business is worth any serious amount of money, you need to stop trying to handle this yourself and get some professional help like an amazon lawyer or well recommended consultant to handle further appeals.   
  
This subreddit has plenty of threads with people discussing options."
2024-12-19,"Was the former company and selling account wound-up correctly with no outstanding balances or other negative actions?

Usually they‚Äôll accept a bona-fide explanation so long as the former account is not blacklisted or otherwise prohibited from selling.

I would certainly appeal again, post some basic details and case number on the forums and expedite to the Executive Team (jeff at Amazon) and not give up."
2024-12-19,The main failure here is believing amazon support when they told you incorrect information.
2024-12-19,"Your feeling would be correct - we switched to FBM exclusively because of theft.

The shrinkage rate at Amazon is disgustingly high and it‚Äôs due to theft - Amazon will never admit this though.

You might consider having your authorized distributor on Amazon set it up for example."
2024-12-19,"From the article:

Why it matters:¬†It's not just corporate employees leaving over the company's aggressive return-to-office policy that Amazon has to worry about. Workers at seven of its facilities walked off the job this morning in what their union is calling the ""largest strike"" against Amazon in US history.

According to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 10,000 workers at ten Amazon facilities, warehouse workers in cities including New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco are taking part in the strike.

The union had given Amazon a December 15 deadline to begin talks with employees, but the company has refused to negotiate contracts with unionized workers.

""If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon's insatiable greed. We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,"" Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien said in a statement.

""These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they've pushed workers to the limit and now they're paying the price. This strike is on them."""
2024-12-19,Amazon execs: 'We can't afford raises.' Also Amazon execs: spends millions lobbying against unions.
2024-12-19,"Amazon sees the union as illegitimate and claims that the Teamsters doesn't represent those workers. 

You would have to assume that their next step will be to fire all the striking workers for missing shifts. 

Then it will go to court, which will take months or years. And in the meantime the workers will have to find another way to make ends meet. It's unfair to them, but this is late-stage Capitalism."
2024-12-19,"They don't want employees to return to the office they want employees to quit so it looks better for Amazon vs firing them.¬†
They just want to pay less employees."
2024-12-19,I hope the rental companies properly price gouge Amazon on office buildings.
2024-12-19,That's wild! I think a company as big as Amazon would have all this figured out before rolling out such mandates. No wonder employees are frustrate how can they return to office if there‚Äôs literally no room for everyone?
2024-12-21,"For anyone reading this:

I work for Amazon.

Many sites have anywhere from one to about a dozen paid *Teamsters* protesting/picketing off property.  None of them are Amazon employees.

The workers are driving right past them and going to work like usual.  No one is striking.  And we're all laughing at these articles making it out to sound like people have walked off the job.  The little gatherings just look sad."
2024-12-20,"If you register and file sales tax in California they absolutely will send you a demand for tax return notice (income tax). When you speak to them they will ask ""do you sell with Amazon FBA?"". If your answer is yes you will owe every year plus LOTS of penalties and interest. Total bullshit, but good luck fighting it.

So be careful where you register for sales tax. At this point, where Amazon is already collecting sales tax, I recommend only registering in your home state if you only sell on 3rd party marketplaces."
2024-12-21,"To be legal, any state where a transaction is made, you need a permit (however the state rquires) and you need to comply with the tax laws of that state.¬†




Last time I checked Amazon submits sales taxes on your behalf in all states but 3 (not sure of this has changed). But you still have to file a $0 return whenever each state requires (monthly, quarterly, or annually).




You are very unlikely to get in trouble of you do this until you are of a size that becomes noticeable by the state ($1m+ in sales, i assume). But of you do not follow these rules, you expose yourself to risk of audits, fines, etc.


If you are having to ask, youre likely not a big enough seller."
2024-12-21,"I‚Äôve been at Amazon for a year. My only complaint is our breaks, because of travel time and the amount of people you often don‚Äôt even get to sit and rest for 10 minutes.

2024-12-21,Amazon just need to pick their hires. Our warehouse has a lot of problematic people and it's bothersome when they spot you and just make work annoying.
2024-12-21,Working at Amazon is like a lotta things... It depends upon what you're looking for & what you're willing to give to get it. The luck-of-the-draw factor is the building you wind up in & who is running it.
2024-12-21,It's not. You never get paid what you're worth. It's still a good job though. The most money I made before Amazon was working outside with concrete at $13 an hour.

If you want to seek things for two weeks, sell on Facebook Marketplace."
2024-12-22,"What you are looking for first is how to find value.

Without that selling on Amazon isn't a thing. You'd lose money"
2024-12-21,"I don't necessarily defend Amazon, I base everything on my experience and research. What the company offers outside of pay was always more important to me. Amazon has the best insurance plans I have ever had, and it isn't meant as a long term career. 
Just from the amount of people who don't know the meaning behind ""It's Always Day One,"" tells me they haven't researched company history. 
Amazon has their crap with them, but pay close attention to what Associates do when they think no one is watching and tell me what you believe is happening ü§î."
2024-12-22,"Better yet let's think about how many associates should‚Äôve been fired but are still around because of Amazon‚Äôs weak policies.

The next day I was fired for a cherrypicked rule. No warning. Just walked out the door. Three years. Amazon is contesting my unemployment claim."
2024-12-22,Yes it‚Äôs that bad and going downhill pretty quickly. It‚Äôs getting riskier and more complicated as hell. I foresee that my business on Amazon will become unprofitable in 3 years. Developing other channels takes time and effort. Diversifying away from Amazon is my highest priority now.

Im building my own site and while that is happening, Im selling on eBay and in person.

Amazon is terrible."
2024-12-22,"Prepare for a whole thread of ""yes"" answers from a mix of quitters who gave up at the first obstacle and people who couldnt bother to read TOS and did themselves in.

I'm reading this from my big ass waterfront house that sits on acres of land. Someone in our verified channel just built a kitchen thats worth more than some peoples houses. Another person in our verified channel is always posting their mclarens and various other cars. Many of them take extended time off for international travel. Today I woke up at noon and my day-to-day isnt full of work anymore as I'm effectively retired. Someone posted an update the other day about their new brand that is already netting $200k per year.

Amazon only sucks if you're a quitter or you're too dumb to make it. Sorry but its true. You cant make a valid argument for why selling on the largest marketplace on the planet is ""that bad"". Anyone can apply to sell and get a chance at part of the market. The nonexistent barrier to entry means a lot of below average people try, fail, and then spend their time talking about how bad it is. The fact is, the bar for ""average"" on amazon is very low. If you have a brain in your head and some drive you can do well on the platform."
2024-12-24, the people out there holding signs are NOT amazon employees. Majority are not Amazon workers.
2024-12-23,This listing is created under my brand name and there is no direct relation with other brands. There was an policy violation but i refused it and amazon accepted there was an error by them. I need some help if someone faced and solved same or similar issue
2024-12-24,">On Monday, an Amazon driver visited the Lakeville Police Department and said they left those packages on the side of the road around 7 p.m. on Saturday ‚Äúbecause they were stressed.‚Äù 

Or.. they planned on going back for them in his/her own vehicle or having an accomplice pick them up.

I mean, if you're just stressed and know you're going to lose your job why not just drop off the still full vehicle when you quit?"
2024-12-25,Most things I sell are 13.99 or 9.99. The nice thing with lower price is it‚Äôs usually also lower cost to get started. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend starting Amazon with anything expensive
2024-12-25,"Depends on the category and your bank roll .

Every single category on Amazon is very very different and should be treated as completely
Different but it‚Äôs never acknowledged online because everyone is afraid of transparency so wont even give a category . 

Example is if you have are going to open a bagel store or pizzeria they are both food ( both on Amazon) but they have virtually zero in common when it comes to planning products , price , business plan etc.

Some things  in common  are both paying the same rent( Amazon fees )  , same for advertising ( sponsored ads ) , same insurance  .

One true flaw of the Internet gurus and so many people fail . The real estate section 8 gurus , the vending guys , the car rental turo guys all give tips that work for them in their city but don‚Äôt work in most cities .
The gurus aren‚Äôt lying just omitting the details that should be common sense but aren‚Äôt"
2024-12-25,Amazon search engine optimization is largely dependent on how much you‚Äôre willing to kick in on Amazon ads as it takes 4-6 clicks for users to end up on non promoted items within Amazon. I use Amazon strictly for being a landing page and provide users with high quality assets outside of Amazon where the conversions happens.
2024-12-25,"There have been plenty of times pulling up to work, while working, and sitting in the breakroom at work thinking of my life choices that ended up with me working at an Amazon warehouse. 

Sad thing is I stayed off drugs, never went to jail and went to college after high school to not get any job offers in my field and Amazon was the best thing I could get.

I‚Äôve had my fair share of BS jobs, grocery store, landscaping, retail and even though the working conditions are worse at Amazon, the time off, insurance, 4 10s schedule, and ease of using the time off is a better combination than I had anywhere else. 

I don‚Äôt know about other areas but it‚Äôs one of the best under $25 an hour jobs in mine when you factor in the total package."
2024-12-26,"There's far worse jobs. I started because I wanted benefits and just did part-time flex. I got promoted in 2 months to L3 and was a PA for over a year. They paid for me to finish my bachelor's and now I'm in grad school. I work in IT and have my own desk. My job is half me browsing the web and half resetting things.

I used to be a trucker. I've done a ton of other stuff and Amazon is so much better. You can go talk to HR instead of having to deal with a horrible boss. You can transfer, and I have twice. There's a lot you get with Amazon that you don't get with other companies."
2024-12-25,"I worked at Amazon for a bit and it wasn‚Äôt that bad but I wasn‚Äôt developing any skills to get a career. I was doing the same job packing everyday.

Costco doesn't even want their customers ordering online, its totally different inventory than in store, basically a different company entirely. And they seemingly cancel more orders than they let through, judging by comments in /r/costco

With all the package theft going on, amazon has me locked in as a customer due to the lockers, although theres some maximum value limit that they won't ship to lockers which i find less than helpful."
2024-12-29,"**Amazon in trouble**? Not always. Amazon has responded to challenges from the competition with resiliency and creativity. But the growth of e-commerce by Walmart and Costco will compel Amazon to change its tactics, particularly in the food and subscription service sectors.

  
**Market Expansion**: Rather than completely taking market share away from Amazon, Walmart and Costco may increase the size of the e-commerce industry as a whole, creating opportunities for several winners.

  
**Long-term Dynamics**: Whether Amazon can continue to maintain its technological and logistical advantage and how well Walmart and Costco grow their online operations will determine the true ""trouble.""

2025-01-01,This company needs to stop conflating their tech workers (thousands) with the delivery workers (million plus) and manipulate headlines. No disrespect to either. Both are great humans. But Amazon likes to generalize when it suits them.

MSDS, FDA 2511 and FDA 2512, CGMP Certification,Mercury-Free Report The product has been tested and complies with all the necessary safety and regulatory standards. These documents were already accepted by Amazon previously, and the listing was reactivated at the time. The current issue appears to stem from the product being listed under the wrong category, which is likely triggering Amazon‚Äôs request for additional third-party lab testing. I‚Äôm now working to have the category corrected to resolve the matter without unnecessary testing. Let me know if you have any further insights or suggestions. I‚Äôd really appreciate it!"
2025-01-02,"So if I don't get the test report from a 3rd party laboratory, will amazon only close my list when my time expires, or will it also take the payment of the products I have sold until that day?"
2025-01-01,"I am not that familiar with US compliance as I work within the EU which is a little more rigorous with regards to product safety. I think 2511 and 2512 are both self-reported documents suggesting that no actual independent testing has been completed. I do know that the regulations changed in the US fairly recently so perhaps the FDA now mandates independent safety testing and Amazon has only just started enforcing it?

This would explain why you didn‚Äôt need these documents before but you need them now. How familiar are you personally with the FDA requirements for cosmetics? If you‚Äôre relying on what an overseas manufacturer is telling you then I would suggest you double check the requirements yourself on the FDA website."
2025-01-03,Sounds like you‚Äôre asking for permission for something you know is not approved by Amazon‚Ä¶ (what you are asking about resolution don‚Äôt you think other people would be doing it as well?  There‚Äôs your sign.üòâ)
2025-01-02,"I believe this is technically against Amazon's TOS, but I'm not sure. But the bigger issue is that you're still going to need to upload identifying information and give your SS#/EIN etc. when it changes hands, right? They can trace that back to your original account."
2025-01-02,People didn't get put out of business by Amazon just because they felt like it.
2025-01-02,"Amazon actively looks for products with high margins that resellers like you proffer.

They have access to a massive dataset to find these things.

But they can only get the data from sales made from their store.  So if you can, stop using their store and giving them that data."
2025-01-02,"I went through this when the box IT stores like CompUSA and Circuit City came onto the scene ... and then the natural progression to online sales ... then competition like NewEgg, CDW, and others that would sell to the public. 

My solution is that I never told anywhere where I bought anything. I based my margins on what my machines should cost ... then if I could squeeze another nickel buying from Amazon or NewEgg vs my standard vendors .... that was another nickel in my pocket."
2025-01-02,"Amazon definitely disrupted a lot of industries

If you actually are providing some service, which includes a place for them to pick up a product or you deliver it, there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from selling it at a premium price compared to Amazon(and nothing wrong with it)

There are a few things I source at Amazon not even so much because of price but because it‚Äôs easy.. and there are some odds and ends things that my vendors either don‚Äôt really supply anymore or the price just seems absurd‚Ä¶ so I might buy it from Amazon and sell it for a profit, but it‚Äôs usually part of a bigger deal‚Ä¶ and not necessarily common


But what I can tell, you is most everything I sell you can find online much cheaper than I will sell it for and while you might not find it all at Amazon, there‚Äôs plenty of people out there who have that kind of an approach where they‚Äôre just looking at volume

So if I was gonna sell something for $400 that I pay $250 for you could probably find somebody selling it for 285 or 300

The product I sell does require some set up, which makes Amazon not the best source for it, though there are dealers like me who might utilize their website to market their products and they might charge additional fees for some of these things

But sadly, the days where you could make a decent living being that middle man on a lot of products cause you had connections with distributors is coming to an end. 

At one time I used to sell a lot of a cellular phone accessories, for example, and I had accounts with the main vendors‚Ä¶ I suppose I still have those accounts, but a lot of those vendors have closed

At one time I could pay two bucks for a car charger and sell it for $10 which was still a lot cheaper than what the retail stores or a Best Buy would sell it for

I don‚Äôt sell as many cell phones as I used to and a lot has changed in regards to the accessories people buy, and it‚Äôs just not worth me trying to carry cases in different colors and for different models and fewer people are buying things like car chargers, but the truth is, you can get everything at Amazon for roughly the same price as I can get a whole wholesale

But a lot of people still go to a Best Buy and pay extra because they want it now or they want to be able to see it‚Ä¶

But if I‚Äôm gonna buy a cellular phone accessory, I get it from Amazon"
2025-01-03,"In my industry vendors had to pick sides. Retail vs online.
So the majority of my vendors (I have well over 250 as this is retail) make us retailers sign exclusivity agreements to never sell on Amazon. This creates an artificial price floor which allows us to survive. So there isn‚Äôt some 20 yr old selling out of his parents garage with no overhead costs.
This benefits the vendor because more sellers not only equals more products going to consumers but more sales as 100s of retailers have to fill hundreds of displays.

What I also have seen is vendors decide to go the Amazon route. They all suffer.  The loss of up to 40% (really it is that much) of sales revenue is not sustainable. The only way it works is to increase units sold by an equivalent amount.

BUT with out hundreds of retailers filling out hundreds of displays across the country they end up with a net decrease in units sold. The first couple quarters look great as Jim‚Äôs warehouse fills out their shelves but they all get a huge kick in the pants when the retailers walk away.

It has become an industry joke, with literal gambling/bets on how long it takes the vendor to come crawling back. (Generally about 4-6 quarters)

The thing is even with all the evidence and trade representatives clearly explaining the problem they don‚Äôt listen because that is a problem for an another financial quarterly report."

They have been trying to force him back in full time despite his contract specifically allowing WFH because they are applying their WFH directives to everyone. The funny thing is that he doesn't have a desk and he mostly works with international colleagues so when goes in, he has a 3 hour round trip commute to bring in his work laptop and then do his work on a random hotdesk and interact remotely with his colleagues anyway. He's also gone in a couple of times and there were no hotdesks free and had to go to a local coffee shop to work at. Imagine having to waste 3 hours a day to work in a coffee shop instead of the comfort of your own home. Madness."
2025-01-03,"By Ashley Stewart:

*[...] The company's real estate team recently started notifying employees that they could continue following their current in-office guidance until workspaces were ready, with delays stretching to as late as May, according to internal Amazon notifications viewed by BI.*

*Affected locations include Atlanta, Houston, Nashville, and New York, the notifications showed. An Amazon spokesperson said buildings would be ready for the majority of Amazon employees by January 2.*

*[...] The five-day-a-week policy is stricter than at some Amazon rivals and, by some accounts, stricter than Amazon's office-work policy before the pandemic.*

*This isn't the first time office-capacity constraints have delayed Amazon's RTO plans. When the company last year ordered employees to start working in the office at least three days a week, many of its buildings weren't ready to accommodate them all.*

*In internal guidelines viewed by BI, Amazon told employees when the new five-day RTO policy was announced in September that they should plan to comply by January 2 whether or not they had assigned workspaces.*

*""For the vast majority of employees, assigned workspaces will be available by January 2, 2025,"" the guidance said. ""If your assigned workspace isn't ready by January 2, we still expect everyone to begin fully working from the office by that date.""*"

2025-01-04,"The position we all applied for is Fulfillment Center Warehouse worker. We did not apply for the position of Picker or Stower, etc. So any warehouse role (picker, packer stower, counter, etc) is fair game.

If you applied for an administrative assistance job, you are expected to perform all the roles of an administrative assistance. Roles include answering the phone, scheduling appointments, entering data in to spreadsheet, attending meetings, etc. You cant apply to administrative assistance and say you dont want to answer the phone but you are willing to enter data into a spreadsheet.

Your analogy is quite dumb. If you are saying administrative assistances shouldnt be doing groundskeeping work, then that is correct. Amazon warehouse workers do not replenish vending machines or repair the heating/AC in the warehouse."

The majority of people prefer rotations in shit jobs like this, it also used to be a completely normal thing employers did to help make the jobs less horrible. 

The reason this isn't a thing anymore is because it was somehow looked at as ""stealing work"". ""stealing work"" was probably my only issue with working in a union shop. No, I'm not ""stealing your work"" I'm trying to help you because we operate as a team you nitwit."

After the seasonal period ended (like most jobs, seasonal employees are let go after christmas), every seasonal employee gets a call after two weeks and we're either offered a full time job or they'll put us on a call back list if they're not hiring anymore. I ended up having to reach out to my store since they never called me back and the head manager legitimately said ""You're not even on the call back list"" after months of praise from my coworkers and even supervisors. I swear like 10 different people, including management, there told me that I'm most likely getting rehired. And when I shopped there a month later everyone was surprised and couldn't figure out why I wasn't on the call back. My guess is that the one single manager that didn't like me had something to do with it but oh well who knows. And here I am now at Amazon ...

2025-01-08,"Manufacturing cost is the cost to create a sellable unit. When you ship a product from a factory in China to you could you immediately sell that? No, there is still work involved.

Also, this is what, 0.1% of your annual revenue? I don't think its really that big a deal.



I do think its scummy though, and the previous way of doing it was a good faith way of doing it from Amazon, but the new way isn't worth getting upset about."
2025-01-08,"Actually may be interesting.  The US government may us this data for tax purposes on some sellers.  They could compare it to import value declarations, which some sellers claim are artificially low to avoid duties.  

I think Amazon should split the difference at least since you are losing potential profit.  Really hurts sellers like me that are sole proprietors and do their own packaging.  Not really a huge deal for me, but could lead to some sellers creating corporations and doing other accounting stuff to get a more representative cost."

You're not missing anything. Amazon now decides where it goes. They may split it automatically when it arrives and ship some elsewhere."
2025-01-08,They no longer specify box contents so you have to split it up into multiple boxes yourself if you want to ship to multiple FCs.  You could also try FBM in addition to FBA to get better initial coverage.  Amazon should spread it out around the country over time so shipping times will average out it just takes a few weeks.

2025-01-12,"Do you have any idea how f‚Äôn big Amazon is? Even an operation that is just 5% of Amazon would be massive. 

Consider that the tiny local hub, or whatever they call it, near me has maybe 200 of those nice little Prime vans in the lot coming and going. The massive complex they built by the airport thats feeds all their fulfillment centers is nearly a million square feet per floor. 

You could take the reported numbers of Amazon gross and net and sorta figure a cost per time to operate and scale done from there but it‚Äôs sorta apples and oranges because Amazon‚Äôs scale and tech that we don‚Äôt have greatly reduces costs. Supposedly they make $1m per minute in profit it Google is correct."

2025-01-11,"I wouldn‚Äôt start out selling clothing on Amazon. Let‚Äôs say you have one product in 4 colors and 5 sizes. That‚Äôs 20 different variations to juggle. Now add 5 more similar products and you‚Äôve got 100 unique SKUs. That‚Äôs going to be a lot of work. 

That‚Äôs just a headache though. The real problem is the return rate. Clothes can have a return rate of like 25%, which is just crazy to me. I average less than 2.5% in my niche. 

Have you looked at your competitors? You can find nice, name brand clothes on Amazon if you know exactly what you‚Äôre looking for. Otherwise, you‚Äôll be wading through page after page of Chinese junk peddlers. Look at their brand names. If it‚Äôs some ridiculous letter-salad of a name, it‚Äôs a Chinese seller. Amazon swears they don‚Äôt, but they have a lot of advantages over US-based sellers. 

The steps to get started are a pretty broad topic. There‚Äôs actually a lot to know and a lot to learn. I spent over a year just learning before I ever spent a cent on my first product. I‚Äôd check out YT. Find some good content creators and get learning."
2025-01-11,"First you'll wanna make sure you've got  yourself a registered trademark. Then go ahead and buy UPCs on GS1, enough in a bunch to cover  the number of individual variants of your products (each size/color combo is a single UPC). 

Create a new Seller Central account with a dedicated business email address. Once that's done, go straight to Brand Registry and register your brand. 

All this forms up your foundation, upon which you'll then start adding your items to Amazon and selling them, either by self fulfillment or FBA. 

You'll then wanna learn about Amazon's advertising strategies and such, black magic as far as I'm concerned, but also critically important, as I hear it."
2025-01-11,"Why? You have to pay to ship and then pay for return shipping for all returns. They are going to buy every size and then return the ones they don't want, which is the 4 other sizes they bought. You won't be able to resell most of it as new. It's even worse if you have Amazon take care of it for you."
2025-01-12,"Sure, and best of luck on your Amazon journey. Make sure to take a few hours and peruse the Seller University once your account is created, it will give you a good foundation on how to start using Amason and its processes. 

Likewise, locate and study the Seller Agreement and other key documentation regarding Amazon's expectations of you and your practices. This is so you don't get caught off guard down the road. Amazon is a real pain in the ass at the best of times, so do your best not to get caught unawares."

2025-01-12,"By Aki Ito, formerly a reporter and editor at Bloomberg News for 10 years, covering the tech industry and the Federal Reserve:

*[...] As of this month, employees at Amazon and AT&T are required to start showing up in the office five days a week. Then, on Tuesday, news broke that JPMorgan is preparing to revoke the hybrid privileges of about 40% of its workforce. (The other 60% are already required to come in every day).*

*[...] Whatever old-school CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Andy Jassy may think of it, remote work is here to stay.*

*For one, take a look at the stats. The economist Nick Bloom runs a monthly survey of American workers that tracks the prevalence of remote work. At the peak of COVID, in the spring of 2020, as much as 62% of work across the economy was being done from home.*

*As the pandemic eased, that number came tumbling down ‚Äî to 37% at the beginning of 2021, 33% in 2022, and 27% in 2023. The work-from-home dream appeared to be fading.*

*But in the two years since, something odd has happened. Despite all the headlines about companies getting rid of hybrid arrangements, the actual prevalence of remote work has barely budged. Last month, the share of work-from-home jobs remained at 27%.*

*[...] In fact, when you zoom out and look at the current status of work from home, what you see is nothing short of a sea change. In 2019, Bloom and his team estimate, only 4.7% of work was performed from home.*

*That means the current level of WFH is still six times larger than it was before the pandemic. For all the Amazons and JPMorgans that are reverting to their pre-COVID policies, the norm remains tilted to hybrid work to a degree that would have been unimaginable back in 2019.*"
2025-01-13,"I‚Äôm all for diversity but when I started at Amazon in a L6 Corporate role I had a coworker with zero years experience in our field and the role level called for 5-6 years experience. They entered through a specific diversity pipeline. This person didn‚Äôt even know how to use the most ubiquitous program in the field, like not even remotely qualified for the role. Meanwhile I had 8 years experience and still took my L6 offer because it was the best offer I could get. 

There‚Äôs a way to do it right, and that‚Äôs not blindly inserting people into roles they aren‚Äôt anywhere near prepared for because they meet a quota."
2025-01-14,"I was thinking about its disappearance last night, wondering if it was being phased out. Returns are such an issue and I guess Amazon thought this program would alleviate that at least as far as clothing. Worked for me a few years ago when I ordered a slew of jeans, sent back all but two and now know what brand fits me. Only used it a couple of more times in the ensuing years and kept what I ordered but it is easy to see how the program would be mostly abused."

2025-01-19,"The one thing I want to point out is, in retirement, you will be an income investor and not a growth investor.  During your working years, you invested in a way to accumulate wealth.  In retirement, you switch over to wealth preservation phase.  In this new phase, the goal is not to gain wealth but to protect your wealth.  You want your assets to generate income to replace the income which you once received at work.  What generates the income is the dividends given out by your stocks.  Though their market prices may go up and down, you are not concerned.  Your only concern is if the stock can continue to pay their dividends. With the exception of Netflix and Amazon, all the stocks you mentioned have a long history of growing dividends.  You really don't need to review your portfolio frequently.  Nevertheless, if investing in ETFs will give you more comfort, I would recommend DGRO and a few covered call ETFs, like JEPI and JEPQ.  DGRO holds all the stocks you mentioned except Amazon and Netflix since they don't give out dividends.  JEPI holds the stocks on the S&P 500 index and write options on them to generate a regular monthly dividend.  JEPQ does the same but holds stocks from the NASDAQ index."

2025-01-20,"Just think about this: if the company is so confident in their ability to make money, why would they need your $20,000? Why wouldn‚Äôt they use their own capital to scale their business and keep all the profits for themselves?

The strategy here is that you give them $20k upfront, but you‚Äôre taking on all the risk. You don‚Äôt see any profits until they supposedly ‚Äúreturn‚Äù your $20k investment. And even after that, you‚Äôre locked into paying them 30% of the profits indefinitely, which means they have ongoing control over your store.

On top of that, you have no guarantee of success. If they mismanage the store, use shady practices, or violate Amazon‚Äôs terms of service, your store could get suspended, and you‚Äôd be out of your investment. This seems way too risky and potentially exploitative.

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Always ask yourself why they need your money in the first place."
2025-01-20,"If they're really that good why don't they just do it for themselves and keep all the profits?

Well.... because it sounds like they are doing RA and will run a account until it gets closed down and it will get closed down that's why they need a constant flow of people to keep opening new accounts for them.

I personally would NEVER give ANYONE access/control of my Amazon account.  Once the account runs into trouble and the Amazon robots shut it down, You're done.  You only get ""one"" Amazon account ever."
2025-01-20,"I would proceed with caution:

\- Amazon FBA and drop shipping is a much more riskier business than some will lead you to believe  
\- All else equal, just due to the nature of Amazon, you may never make the $20K back  
\- They're also selling this service to other aspiring Amazon sellers who may even be selling the same products

Doing the research and learning how to run your own Amazon FBA store isn't THAT hard (you just need to read everything you can, and avoid the ""gurus""), and you can have really nicely done merchandising content (Store, PDPs, etc.) done for a fraction of the $20K."

Related, but *different*: Amazon Handmade accounts require a Seller Central account (or maybe better to say that they are just an SC account with access to AH features). When one sets-up an AH account, Amazon charges the $39.99 SC fee. AH support then refunds it and does something so it is never charged again.

2025-01-20,Copy. I've seen that on eBay and ordered a few myself that happened to be counterfeits. I could tell because they were obviously super compressed and when I would check them out on my computer they would be DVD fives versus DVD 9s. I had no idea that was also an issue on Amazon. Uggh.

What you are saying you want and what you have are completely opposites. I own Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon as well, but it fits within my financial plan.

2025-01-21,"I definitely think you have the right mindset and are on the right path. But a few notes-

I often see portfolios in this sub made up of high yielding crappy companies (yield chasers, don't be one). Stocks typically have a high yield because the stock price has deteriorated. And just because a stock price is down, that doesn't mean it's now a ""buy"". In most cases, capital appreciation (stock price) is more important than dividend yield.¬†

However, you can play both capital appreciation and dividends. This is essentially what I do. I have rules that I abide by (5 years of dividend growth, and a 5 year dividend cagr of at least 10% (the average annual rate at which the dividend is increased)). There are plenty of solid companies that are not only growing themselves at a high rate, but are also growing their dividend. Capital appreciation + dividend growth over a long period of time is a winner. Look at companies (not financial advice) like Texas Roadhouse, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Costco, Moody's, Broadcom, Wabtec, Microsoft, etc. All of those companies are growing through capital appreciation and dividends. You don't need to have simply growth. Not saying you can't, there's probably nothing wrong with going all in in Google, Amazon, Netflix, Meta, etc. They're all fantastic companies.

But what im getting at is if you're also interested in dividends, you can play both growth and dividends."

2025-01-24,">Amazon will close all 7 warehouses in Canada's Quebec province, eliminating 1700 jobs

The concentration of wealth and power among a few mega-monopolies, such as Amazon, only serves to fuel economic instability and exacerbates the deep inequality plaguing our nations.

What is needed is the revitalization of antitrust regulations, a return to tough laws designed to ensure corporate transparency and accountability, and prioritizing small businesses and local economies‚Äîthe true drivers of economic growth‚Äîover the whims of monopolistic giants that stifle competition, innovation, and contradict the principles of a 'free market‚Äù by their very existence.

But as they say ""*Good luck with that*"" as at this moment rightwing corruption is so deeply entrenched within all 3 branches of the U.S. gov't it will truly be a miracle if this nation is ever able to extricate from this predominately Republican corporate-fascist nightmare. Still it is a worthy goal to strive towards, imo.

The power to lay off 1,700 workers with a single decision should NEVER rest in the hands of one individual or company. In my view, this is an affront to fairness and underscores why healthy economies require hundreds‚Äîif not thousands‚Äîof small businesses, rather than a single massive corporation led by a pathologically greedy individual.

>*""The growth of monopolies is a major contributor to the decline of the middle class.

2025-01-24,Cause Amazon is not focused on increasing their profitability at the moment. They are heavily reinvesting into capex and continuing to focus primarily on revenue growth and operating cash flow growth.
2025-01-24,"Amazon is a long way away from being oversaturated. Matter of fact they are just in the very early stages of ecommerce, cloud and advertising.  

Ecommerce: Amazon currently owns a 40% market share in ecommerce and gaining but ecommerce is only 15% of total retail in the United States. Who is going to be the biggest beneficiary when ecommerce grows to 35%-40% of US retail in the next several years. Based upon the above numbers Amazon currently owns 6% of retail in the US with 94% yet to go.
These numbers don‚Äôt account for international ecommerce which has almost an infinite amount of growth potential.

AWS: Amazon currently owns a 31% market share of cloud computing but cloud computing only represents ~ 12% of all enterprise IT. Who is going to benefit the most when penetration rates eclipse 70%-80% enterprise cloud adoption. These numbers will be staggering.

Advertising: Amazon currently has a $50+ billion run rate with 40% margins growing 20% per year. They are third in advertising market share behind Google and Meta with lots of room to run."

2025-01-24,"I don't have a numbers breakdown but Amazon invested very heavily in infrastructure for warehouses, delivery, and data centers.  That is now showing up on their books as depreciation expense even though it has already been paid and will generate revenues for a long time, and so the P/E may be somewhat misleading."
2025-01-24,"It is easier to understand Amazon by examining the businesses 3 main segments: AWS, Ecommerce, and advertising. What kind of margins could each of these businesses do now if Amazon wasn't aggressively growing them? AWS likely >35%, ecommerce 3-4%, and advertising >35%. Personally, I think the AWS and advertising are conservative estimates. Amazon could be doing 70B in free cash flow if it wanted. That would suggest it is currently trading 35x this conservative assumption. Still pricey but not ludicrous."

Sure there's gonna be saturation, but AWS is the king of data storage, just like NVDA was/is the king of GPUs. The only difference is everyone is already in on AMZN."
2025-01-24,Their PE is skewed because they reinvest a larger share of their profits to fuel future growth. Look at Bezos‚Äô first letter to shareholders. Amazon trades based on FCF growth percentage.
2025-01-24,I just gave up and had them destroy my product. Aka they stole my product and are now selling it as Amazon owned and shipped.
2025-01-25,"Amazon did not ""steal your inventory"". That doesnt happen.  Amazon disposed of your inventory because you couldnt prove it was from a legit source. If Amazon started selling the same product after, it had nothing to do with you and the claim they stole it is baseless. They have internal processes for this stuff and there is no possible way they are going to take your questionable inventory and retail it themselves. That isnt reality."
2025-01-25,Sounds like you work for Amazon. The invoices I have are legit from the brand itself and Amazon now doesn‚Äôt want to take them? Oh and they just somehow happen to sell the same amount of product that was in my accounts FBA inventory?
2025-01-25,"> The invoices I have are legit from the brand itself and Amazon now doesn‚Äôt want to take them? 

According to you. Chances are you arent giving them an invoice and you're giving them a receipt, or they arent able to confirm the supplier on that invoice is legitimate. 9 times out of 10 someone says this, they bought from a retail store or they bought from a liquidator and they are giving amazon a receipt instead of an invoice. They also usually dont have a letter of authorization. You cant just buy whatever you want and resell it.

> Oh and they just somehow happen to sell the same amount of product that was in my accounts FBA inventory?

Yes. Yes thats literally all there is to it. It is delusional to think that theres some splinter cell inside of amazon thats making up nonsense reasons to suspend wholesalers so they can scoop up your questiuonable, possibly counterfeit inventory and then sell it themselves. Amazon is one of the largest companies there is and they can source anything you can source at a better price than you can source it. They dont need or want your sketchy inventory. Amazon has processes and the people who work there follow those processes. Its a huge organization. They can only deviate so much. You are being delusional."
2025-01-24,"For selling outside your home country it's best to opt-in for Union OSS for single declaration. You need to confirm this in your Amazon Seller account.

2025-01-25,"I think titles should be as short as necessary to include your top 5-10 keywords, and be readable by a human. What Amazon is trying to do is stop unreadable keyword cramming. So the shorter you can make it while still hitting your main keywords, the better."
2025-01-25,"Pros: ur products are on amazon. Cons: still nothing sells. nobody knows your brand and as soon as competitors see, it‚Äôs copied and sold on temu."
2025-01-25,"We started selling on Amazon about two years ago after resisting vehemently. Our business predates Amazon, and our products are pretty unique and specific, so we always figured we weren't really competing with their offerings too much. 

The good: a handful of things we listed have done great. Like 500% more sales than we did through our own online and over years of selling. These products are only a small component of our business so it's not like a life changing revenue difference, but it's clearly given us additional exposure. These products are fairly low cost things, $30-60 items and frankly we never liked dealing with these types of orders in our regular business. By the time you consider taking the order, overhead, storage, shipping etc, it's hard to want to cater to this area of sales when you have bigger orders and clients that are your bread and butter. This can vary depending on your business of course, we just didn't particularly care of the hassle of ""micro"" orders. Amazon FBA on the other hand loves selling small orders and they're happy to deal with the customer service and shipping.

The bad: Their inbound receiving has been an absolute shit show lately. Our last pallet of products shipped out on December 2nd. It's STILL waiting to get checked in and has been delayed twice already. The next ""estimated date"" in now Feb 10. I will be surprised if it makes that date either. 4-6 weeks has been the norm for us generally. This massive delay makes it hard to plan inventory and keep things in stock. They also charge you for storage so you're trying to manage stock levels. For a company that was built on lightning fast prime shipping, their receiving is the worst I've ever seen. 

It can be fairly time consuming to list products and get approvals. This gets easier with some practice but their backend system isn't as intuitive as I would have expected from one of the most successful global companies. Product photos need to be edited in specific ways and you'll inevitably get denied for things that comply etc..It can sometimes take days or weeks to get a product listed as intended.


Product packaging, labeling, and shipping to them can be a little tricky too. Inside boxes, case boxes, pallets...Three levels of labeling. They are very particular about this and adds some unrealized time expense to doublecheck your work or come up with a fool proof process sometimes. 

We will continue doing it begrudgingly although I hate it and part of me would love to boycott them altogether for a number of reasons."
2025-01-25,I sell quite a bit on Amazon. They treat sellers like shit but that is where the people are.
2025-01-25,"Pros: massive marketplace 

Cons:

Customers constantly return used items. I offer huge discounts to business accounts simply because my business accounts have a 0% return rate. 

Never exactly know when you are going to get paid.

Customers can say almost whatever they want and Amazon will most likely agree with them."
2025-01-26,"The advice is to... lower your character count to 80. 

We don't have suggestions for how to circumvent Amazon's systems, we wouldn't give them if we did. Amazon's been building toward a policy of brief product titles for ages.

There's always the possibility support is just wrong, of course. Do you get a different error message in MYI? How about when you submit a flat file?"
2025-01-26,Amazon is really starting to crack down on name stuffing. I received an email recently about new restrictions on character count and over using the same word in a title. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just taking time for it to filter to all listings it will affect. I‚Äôm taking it as a good sign that ‚Äúhair brush detangling brush for curly hair curling brush tangle free brush wet hair brush‚Äù will be a thing of the past.

They have a lot of bad policies of course but most are justified"
2025-01-26,Sadly Amazon management is set up to beat your PAs into the ground while they do their job and the job of their Area Managers. Corporate has designed the Area Manager program to fail. They don‚Äôt want people to stay in that role long. Move up or quit.
2025-01-26,For me it‚Äôs simple fact of the onsite hr actually never being on site and managers not actually knowing Amazon policy or too scared to take action. So that leaves me no option but to go down the erc rabbit hole.
2025-01-26,Well people would only call you if there are issue. For the most part there aren't any issues. I suggest you check out some YouTube videos to see what it's like inside an Amazon.
2025-01-28,"I get units from removal orders months after they are ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù. If the inventory is worth less than $300 maybe chat support can escalate and close your account? Or you can choose to dispose/liquidate the leftover inventory?

Sometimes starting a thread on the seller forums can get the attention of an Amazon employee who can actually do something. Sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this, and congrats on moving on from the FBA nightmare."
2025-01-28,"How do you currently keep records/reconcile for tax purposes? 

If you're going into this for the long run and starting a business, might be worth investing in link my books and xero (accounting software), and LmB links Amazon to xero and will convert currencies, but since you're earning in USD it will always be USD in Amazon under the US market place."
2025-01-30,"Product names don't make best sellers on Amazon, actual sales do and the reviews score for that product.

While an argument can be made that a strong product name may be relevant in returning search results, and that could result in higher sales, the words you have are collected are mostly product details or features and not quite effective based on the very large grouping of best sellers.

Refining your group down to say best selling car covers, and looking for high keyword frequency could prove to be valuable in providing a strong captivating product title for the sale of car covers, or show a popular trending feature that buyers value in car covers."
2025-01-29,"Money. The answer is almost always money. I don't know any other job that doesn't require experience and gives this good of benefits and pay. About to be 5 years with the company and yeah it's boring, but it's worth it no matter how much I hate the place and people

Edit: All of a sudden everyone got a job outside Amazon that is miles better with no experience yet they still lingering in the sub like an angry ex girlfriend"
2025-01-29,For me it‚Äôs the ability to grow. I started as a T1 in 2020 pre covid with no degree. I just accepted a L6 offer 1 month before my 5 year amaversary. That coupled with the ability to go anywhere Amazon has a presence and the benefits makes it a no brainer for me.

2025-01-30,Great so now we should expect higher inbound placement fees?  Amazon pick ups only?
2025-01-31,Depends on the agreement you have with the brand.  I have a few products that don‚Äôt allow us to sell on Amazon. I dropped some of those brands because it was after years of business and they weren‚Äôt critical.  Others told me when I started selling them and I was fine because I knew going in.  They don‚Äôt have to sell to you so they may cut you off from product if you continue to sell on Amazon.
2025-01-31,"Nothing you can do except evaluate if you need to sell those brands to survive?  

I am in automotive parts/accessories and have run across this with several brands.  We dumped one after a 16 year relationship because in addition to Amazon and eBay issues, they also wanted to dictate what other competing brands we could sell without any additional compensation or margin for being exclusive to them.  
  
A few other brands are important enough that we don't fight them on it.  Thank god they are at least good at making whoever is selling on Amazon sell at MAP price so we can compete."
2025-01-30,"There are around 20-30 snoring strips on Amazon that claim they stop snoring, make you breath better, etc and they are all Chinese brands with no certification or approvals from health Canada.

If you suspect USPTO fraud, consider reporting it to the **FBI or FTC**. Keep fighting!"
2025-02-01,"This is unfortunately very common. Make sure you are subscribed via email to any alerts or changes to your USPTO reg.

Less common these days, but it used to be very common for people to trademark a competitors brand name to shut them down on Amazon. If you sell a product under your brand name but you havent filed for a trademark, someone else can file for it first. Yes, its illegal, but for a new seller it doesnt make sense to try to fight it.

This still happens with Chinese trademarks. If you have a US trademark, you better get your trademark registered in China too. If you dont, someone else can do it LEGALLY. Once someone has a chinese trademark they can prevent you from exporting from China. Basically business ending for a lot of people."
2025-01-31,"Good lord that‚Äôs awful, I‚Äôm so sorry and I look forward to updates. I would definitely contact one of the Amazon attorney specialist and see what kinda of recourse you can seek if anything.

2025-02-02,"Amazon is great if you have the margins required (75%+ gross). Once you managed ranking for certain keywords you‚Äôll get constant organic sales. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs easier than your own website if it‚Äôs a product that already exists in a similar way and is searched for, and you‚Äôre creating another new slight variation. For me, it helped me getting that initial demand so I was able to get above comanufacturer MOQ levels.

If you‚Äôre creating an entirely new niche that people need to be educated about, I‚Äôd say go for your own website & social media marketing instead"
2025-02-02,"I don‚Äôt think the margins will be over %75 (maybe for few products) buy I don‚Äôt really think every seller on Amazon makes so much profit. At the beginning I have to make the consumers use the product so I have to give some products FOC. Meaning I won‚Äôt make the profit that I am targeting for a while. I just want to increase the orders through selling in different markets so that I can compensate some initial costs. 

I‚Äôll also have my own website to sell but Amazon is the easiest way to be available globally. But is it also using different tactics to kill your profit just like the other e-commerce companies?"

2024-10-04,"Two years and the Meta sentiment really has done a complete 180. 

Price really does drive narrative..Sherwin-Williams has beaten the market almost every year for the last 20 years. Its a quiet company that keeps chugging alone, boring like a paint drying..CAT up over 240%.Google.

Money-making machine. Good projected growth. No debt. Just began with dividend.

 Only at 19 forward PE.Meta looks overvalued compared to Google at this point. Google makes 2x as much money from Ads and almost 3x in revenue, and has more diversified revenue streams, than meta. Meta revenue is literally 98% from ads. Google's advertising business is 2x as big AND they have ~80B a year in revenue from non advertising sources (subscriptions + cloud which are growing much faster than Ads...), and theyre worth something like~1.25X that of Meta. I don't quite understand it tbh, metas advertising business is growing more quickly than googles but googles ad business is 2x as big and their other sources of revenue are growing just as quick if not more quickly than meta's ads.

I wouldn't be surprised though if meta passes Google in market cap by next year given how much wall street hates Google..VRT isn‚Äôt necessarily a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù gem, but it‚Äôs not become mainstream on Reddit. Their exposure to AI data centers is promising.

Meta - 18 months ago. RKLB or ASTS may 100x in 10 years - but they‚Äôre still tiny companies not making money yet. LLY isn‚Äôt cheap.

2024-02-02,"People who think that companies will ""just switch"" from AWS to Azure don't understand what they're talking about. I'm a cloud engineer and honestly, you don't just switch from one cloud platform to another. It will be years and years of hassle. Vendor lock in is a serious moat with cloud..Amazon's a great company, with a strong moat around the cloud business in particular.

Its core ecommerce moat is still extensive, though might come under pressure within 5 years - the competition in this space will likely heat up significantly.

Is it cheaper than Google? Depends on what you look at. By EV/EBITDA, Google is only 17.4X when Amazon is 22.2X, and Amazon's more capital intensive.

But there‚Äôs enough people wanting to move to Seattle just work and get drunk afterwards, if not during..Most FAANG companies like Amazon new hires get RSUs upon hire that vests over four years. In addition bonus cut off is usually Oct first and bonus pay out usually around April 1. 

People who quit now walk away 2025 bonus and all invested RSUs. 

New hires are too late to get 2025 bonus. 

People who quit get zero severance or unemployment. 

And new hires unless un boarded by Jan 1 2025 their 2026 bonus is prorated. 

I quit a FAANG in May lost two years RSUs and boss dragged replacing me till November. Boss saved six months salary and new hire missed 10-1 bonus cut off. Plus company got back $150k unvested RSUs. 

They paid new hire more than me so what. They saved a boat load.[deleted].Flash sale buy now.If you think the dip in their stock price has anything to do with the correlation of their RTO policy announcement, you're out of your depth. Sounds like you're painfully reaching to prove a not-so-hidden agenda point."

Too bad I have other parts coming I need to wait on.

Haven't heard back just yet.Amazon has a market cap of $2.1 Trillion. They won't even notice a $5 B sale. $5 Billion is not even an average day's trading volume..All that really matters for stock price is earnings and expectation of future earnings/growth of the company. 

I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about the fact that one person is selling. Remember 5 billion only represents 0.2% of the market cap of the company..Steam sale is on!.They all do this all the time.  Most of them don‚Äôt earn a salary so they sell shares to cash flow their life.  This is very very very normal and if you pay attention you can find 100s of articles likes this in the past..He‚Äôs prepping an all cash offer to buy the Seattle Seahawks from Jody Allen (I would guess).

2024-03-03,"re: ad bids being inflated - I don't see how that works. The ad runs a second price auction. 

So if you bid up to $1 but the next bid is only $0.5, iirc you're charged $0.51. 

The rest of your analysis seems interesting but wanted to point out the the bidding.The 5th largest company in the world by market cap is going to be successful.

Bro, I‚Äôm in..This is interesting and the type of thing that Peter Lynch was talking about when he told people to buy what they know. I can't stand it when people use that quote as a justification to buy Costco at 69x because it's always busy when they go there..Interesting write up. On one hand, I agree with you that the changes you are describing are good for short term profitability. On the other hand, turning their entire company into a flea market does not seem accretive to long term shareholder value. If I want knock-offs  or relabeled aliexpress stuff, I can just go direct to that platform. 

I worked for a company that sold to Amazon, and the experience of having to deal with all of the counterfeit and grey market items in their marketplace dissuaded me from ever buying from any 3rd party seller there. And since Amazon has made it harder to filter by seller, I've largely stopped buying from them at all. 

That said, I know a ton of people who have Amazon packages delivered multiple times per day. Should probably consider adding to my position, too, lol..buy calls.Idk, on the other hand they‚Äôre turning prime into something that has nice value to shit.  People are generally lazy and won‚Äôt backlash as they should, so I guess it could land either way..You‚Äôre a fkin beast love this logic.Solid logic, also why Amazon has a strong chart, reliable growth and ridiculous p/e. You buy Amazon at any price and just hold it..As someone who has also sold on Amazon for about 10 years. Initially quite successfully and profitably (about 1mill euro p.a for first few years - now about 100k per annum!), I can certainly see how well this model works for amazon.

amazon makes money whether you win, lose or draw. If you're unsuccessful - they make money on storage fees and ads. If you're moderately succesful, they make money on storage fees, fulfillment fees, ad fees and commission. If you're very successful - they'll make money on all of this until they decide to cut you out of the equation completely by selling a competing product themselves!

  
*What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.*

That's absolutely bonkers. They charge extra fees for having TOO MUCH stock, now they're charging for having too little? Seriously, fuck that. We still sell on amazon but are already in the process of switching from FBA to a 3PL company - who despite being a bit more expensive - at least don't have policies that feel like someone is shitting in your mouth. Amazon has also just become such a pain to list on and get visibility. Most of our sales now come from our own website, which tbh is easier than managing an Amazon account.Don't take this personally, but you (by which I mean 'third party sellers') is why we went from spending high six figures per year through Amazon to zero.  Maybe not you specifically, but many third party merchants range from terrible to crooked.  Amazon became a crapshoot of what product or service you would get.  

Early on we could steer and filter to Amazon-fulfillment only, but they became so integrated with crummy third party sellers that it was impossible to stay clear.  And third party sellers were also infesting Amazon fulfillment, with returns and counterfeit items migrating from the third party side into the Amazon side.  

For perspective, we had direct access to people second to Bezos.  But seeing how Amazon was not only doing little to curb the problem but instead was enabling and expanding them, we went cold turkey.  

So in a sense, we'd agree.  Amazon's rapacious conduct and philosophy is not something I want to do business with, but is something I expected to show up as EPS, and thus grew the equity position.  

At times I've questioned if Amazon's 180 into anti-customer anti-partner anti-everybody practices would sabotage their growth.  But it seems like they've been able to ride that out with some assistance from the pandemic.  

Amazon used to delight customers.  Now, customers just seem to tolerate them.  And most customers don't even know what you do, which is that most of the customer-aligned practices like returns or refunds are fully funded by the vendors and suppliers they strongarm, not by Amazon's generosity.

I too have used awareness of a company's bad practices as a thesis for holding the equity.  The bitterness of Apple's terrible policies and corrupt practices was moderated by knowing I could pay for the warranties they wouldn't honor by using stock gains.

I've said we'll go back to Amazon they day they end third party, but it doesn't seem like that's happening anytime soon."

I feel like there is a perfectly valid reason for this, although I cannot think of one..Can't redeem custom amounts, 5 and 10‚Ç¨ are perfectly fine.

I don't think it's for a price change, they haven't really evolved since all those years, and they wold have blocked everything, not just amazon custom amount. It's probably because it's soon chrismas, and they are trying to make people not give out amazon cards, but xbox or microsoft card instead. Because for them, giving xbox card is basically free money (they just have to pay the dev fees. But not if the dev are also microsoft), while amazon card actually cost them 5$.

I didn't checked, but if it's the same thing for xbox, it might also be to incentivize people to buy the gift card instead of just redeeming it. Because then instead of you just getting 30$ for free, you might purchase a 30$ gift card for chrismas, and redeeming 20$"

2023-06-01,"[deleted].With all this in-office mandates in combination with workers not wanting to go in, it seems like the market is RIPE for new startups (or even older companies who were falling behind in the tech side of things) to snatch up all this talent at a steal if they're willing to allow remote work.

My next job will 100% be remote, and I'm willing to take a pay cut for it if it means working from the comfort of my own home.

Edit: Lots of people bringing up good points too. Like even if a job is a pay cut, it might not actually be a cut because you get hours per day back from the lack of a commute, the cost of gas, and mental health. That's before even accounting for family costs like day care or being able to live in a lower cost of living area.

Then there's the argument that workers don't have the advantage right now. Which I think is true, for now, due to the economy. Except we now have hordes of people like me that's window shopping for remote roles and ready to drop the job once a remote role is found. I don't care if it takes me 1 week or 3 years to find a remote role. As soon as find one, I'm never going back. If I ever need to go back to in-office, you can bet I'm going to start window shopping again.

People's desire for remote role will only give companies who hire remote the advantage in having the first pick of the available talent..Due to an unexpected event the world PROVED beyond a doubt that work from home was fine and the shit heads in charge still can‚Äôt accept it..I'm in the R~~TO~~emote advocacy channel in Amazon slack and I signed the initial petition, but this walkout scheduled at lunch time was a joke.Climate goals and forced return to office don't mix.I work for a company that is 100% remote, and I've been working from home since 2018.  It's fucking fantastic.  I get WAY more done than I would if I were in the office, and my stress level has gone down considerably..Everyone who has been going back in to the office is on zoom calls all day anyway. 

The only people who support it are incompetent middle and upper management..I say this in every ""return to work"" thread I come across.

The office as an institution is very important to a lot of older people (Most decision makers in companies). It's not about more/less productive to them, it's about everyone gathering every day and doing the things that you only do in the office. Socializing, impromptu meetings, going to lunch together, etc. For people that have spent 20+ years enjoying the office experience, the thought of working from home disgusts them. All of the reasons they think work from home doesn't work are just rationalizations to try to get everyone back in the office so they can have their office experience..Used to work for Amazon. Middle management could all be replaced by automation. I'm sure they went nuts during the remote work period at the existential crisis that is realizing you add nothing.

Join the cool kids.I interviewed for them last year and was warned they would expect to be in the office a year ago. I asked about the team and they told me they were all in a different city than the office they recommended. I was a free agent who could relocate to a few cities including Seattle if needed. I asked what am I doing in the office. Person said I would have to go to an office. Seemed pretty clear they were just trying to check a box of employee sits at our desk..I hope this shows people that they should never ever consider Amazon as an employer. One of the most terrible places you can possibly work..Amazon missed growth for 1st Quarter,  first since 2015.

So... yeah, gonna cut costs any way they can..When I lived in Seattle, very few looked at Amazon as a ""career"" type place. They did their time, got their deferred stock and were outta there. The culture was the culture, you tolerated it as long as you could, learned to dodge boobytraps, made few friends, knew the risks, but the rewards outweighed the risks if you played your cards right and knew it was but a temporary stop. So nothing here surprises me in the least..AOC was right about not giving Amazon billions in tax breaks to build HQ2 in NYC..Amazon‚Ä¶‚Äúnow requires its employees to commit to office work at least three days a week.‚Äù

Why does this article phrase it this way? I can commit to ‚Äúoffice work‚Äù 5 days a week - at my home office. Work is work whether you are in a home office or the company‚Äôs office.

Same as when some news source says ‚Äúreturn to work‚Äù üôÑ If the work isn‚Äôt getting done, there is a bigger issue than butts in seats!.Sounds like constructive dismissal I think it's called.  It's basically a lay off as far as unemployment is concerned.  Make them fire you..The comments to the article on seattletimes.com are pretty rich too. At least one person saying that big tech companies have the data that shows team productivity takes a major hit with remote work. Sounds to me like another brainwashed person just listening to what they are told/drinking the kool-aid‚Ä¶.My job is pretty safely staying wfh but it still makes me nervous that my employer could randomly pull this one day."
2023-11-13,"I wish they would stay away from stuff like that and actually make Amazon better or cheaper if they can.Is this because they acquired the rights of a huge game that failed?.Meanwhile they're publishing Blue Protoco soonTM..I don‚Äôt have any idea what it is that they‚Äôre cancelling or what their free games are that they‚Äôre going to focus more on..In regards to Prime Gaming;

>As for Prime Gaming‚Äôs free games, which you can access if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve listened to our customers and we know delivering free games every month is what they want most, so we are refining our Prime benefit to increase our focus there,‚Äù Hartmann wrote.

One of the things that makes up some of the value behind my sub, I otherwise don't order enough deliveries for the recent +40% increase in Prime AU..It's so incredibly easy to spot the difference between games created out of love and games created out of love of money. Amazon (like many publishers) has no artistic passion at its core; it is a capitalist machine. Anything they put out will be a hollow farce compared to the games we've come to know and loved..I had no idea that Amazon, owner of Twitch, had their own ""gaming"" channel on Twitch. How horribly mismanaged of a company is this? I tried watching a bit of their past VOD's, but could barely sit through a few minutes. I know that not everyone is going to enjoy the same content as others, but wow it just shows that they have no clue what they're doing when it comes to Twitch or gaming in general.

How many people did it take to run a gaming channel on Twitch? Why did they need 180 people to do that? They had a two hour stream about once a week!  Just have some people stream a few hours a day and promote Prime Gaming, new games, free games on Amazon, etc. It's not difficult. Basically anyone can do that from their own home these days. What a horribly run business..Look, it's terrible that people lost their jobs. But honestly, what were all those people even doing? 

> This includes the entirety of Crown Channel, an Amazon-backed Twitch channel, and the Game Growth team...

180 people split between two Twitch channels for promoting games? How in the world did that need *180* people?.Love prime gaming.Amazon Luna is probably next"
2023-07-06,"Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon fell 34% in the first half of 2023, preliminary government data showed on Thursday, hitting its lowest level in four years as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva institutes tougher environmental policies.

That is pretty solid good news in a world that is a bit lean these days with upbeat stories in the press..[deleted].Huh. Elections do matter..[removed].This is a wonderful, direct consequence for an election, the Brazilians should be applauded for voting out bolsonaro... we should all be inspired to oust these anti-environment fascists at the earliest opportunity.What does it when deforestation drops 34%? It only gets deforested at 2/3 of the previous rate?.Last president was a disgrace at every level. Glad that POS is ineligible for a while. Now there's hope his entire movement dies as well. Worst thing to happen to this country (and that says a lot) in a good while. Now it's your turn USA..some good news.So, from way way way too fucking much, to way way too fucking much.Still think Brazil needs to be compensated for the rainforest.  It‚Äôs a global resource that we pretty need to survive. Imagine if Saudi couldn‚Äôt drill for oil etc .. pretty much every country is entitled to access their resources with little impact to the planet (excluding accidents etc).

2023-10-14,Pretty common i lived in an apartment complex and they always delivered to the office never to the door.The amount of packages Amazon drivers do is insane for the pay. Flex drivers use personal vehicles and are paid the same no matter how long it takes. Amazon doesn‚Äôt care about them so the driver really doesn‚Äôt care about the package or the customer. If reported they get penalized whether it was delivered properly or not so there is no incentive to ‚Äúgo the extra mile‚Äù and take to each door to ensure they don‚Äôt get penalized. The driver is making a calculated risk in these situations on whether delivering those packages to all doors and taking 15 to 45 minutes vs 3 to 5 minutes to leave in the lobby and nobody reports a lost package. If it‚Äôs stolen Amazon will send another..Amazon driver cosplaying as Santa..Go look at the amazondspdrivers sub. You‚Äôll get it..You want them to put them under your pillow? This is normal for almost all apartment buildings..What else are they supposed to do. They leave them on my unmanned doorstep..?? This is normal. You want them to go to every apartment? That‚Äôs just ridiculous..The honor system. That means he trusts you and your neighbors..Come down and get your shit.This is pretty standard. Just move into an apartment complex?
2023-12-30,"You'll win chargeback..I got a message once from Amazon saying ‚Äúdestroyed in transit and returned to manufacturer, call Amazon for refund‚Äù, when I called they said I had to send it back. It was a long call, but they finally just refunded..Yeah I just canceled my prime over this shit. So frustrating lol, they moved my refund date back 4 times so I just disputed the charge. Their customer service used to be so solid and now it‚Äôs ridiculously bad. 

They emailed me afterwards to be like ‚Äúoh hey you disputed this and we need you to pay for the order‚Äù 

Absolute clown house nowadays..I stopped giving Amazon my business for large purchases. I always go to Target, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H, and Home Depot. One benefit of that is you no longer have to scroll through pages of AliExpress junk to find what you're looking for..>I contacted support, and the guy was so clueless he started offering to arrange a pick up with UPS for me to return the item (kindly offering that service for free :)) He can‚Äôt even see that it‚Äôs already been returned 3 weeks ago

Frustrating, isn't it?.Try disputing with your credit card company.Chargeback. You‚Äôll win. It even says lost in transit, and you dropped it off in person..I deal with Amazon on a business level. The business level dealings really spotlight how truly awful they are‚Ä¶not only the company but the people that work there in high-level positions. Absolutely disgusting attitudes, terrible morals and so entitled. The amount of foot stomping, temper tantrum behavior is appalling. Verbally abusive, condescending and rude. Owing millions and millions of dollars and refusing to pay. Deciding on their own, after receiving goods and services, that they don‚Äôt owe. Using every shady tactic to get what they want and sharing those tactics with other people in the company so they can use them too..I've had this happen to me as well. Two weeks went by with no refund. Called my CC company and they took care of it. F\*ck Amazon. They've outsourced their customer service to clueless drones that don't know how to handle the simplest things..Returned a used headphone last month. Even though status said it was received, the actual refund date kept on moving further away every week. 

I went in Amazon chat a few days ago and they made up some BS excuse so how ‚Äúbig‚Äù refund e sometimes need more time. 

Then yesterday when I called, they approved the refund on the spot. I feel like they don‚Äôt even have excuses anymore, for some reason they try to pro-long refunds."

2023-09-06,"Time to make euro tech great again!!.EU sneaked ByteDance in there just so the 'gatekeeping' list wouldn't be solely American.I know this sub doesnt want to hear this but, this is a good thing. These companies need to be shackled but government corruption and the seduction of capitalism are hard to resist.

Any comoany with real potential for competition gets bought out. Any threats can be subdued with a willingness to price out the competition with discounts/losses until they fold.

How can we allow a company to be a social media network, streaming network, supermarket, clothing store, delivery service, server provider, manufacturer, etc, company. And don't even get me started on the data they're gathering and what they're doing with itm

 They buy out the competition.

An honest government not corrupted by money would've put the shackles on these companies. They can still profit while looking out for people first and foremost..[removed].Where's the dip?hopefully down to $100 a share..The European Union is really trying hard to get as behind as possible.Europoors doing their thing.Eu makes money by fining American corporations. They have nothing of their own.The part that rubs me the wrong way is fining companies on global turnover instead of EU turnover. It‚Äôs so nice of them to enforce their laws and collect penalties on money made outside of their own countries (for the good of everyone of course)..Some of the comments here are genuinely astonishing."
2023-09-04,"[deleted].NZ internet is a hell of a lot better than American internet. Fiber roll out has been delayed time and time again but at least we don‚Äôt have anyone still using dial up due to infrastructure issues..I would like to add that New Zealand really isn't that close to Australia. Geographically it is the only thing nearby but Sydney to Auckland is equivalent to London to Kyiv or New York to Oklahoma City. We get shafted because distances are much greater and comparatively no-one lives here but we are also quite rich countries. We pay more because we can..On the Internet subject, if you're getting 300ms latency, there is an issue.  Probably crappy ISP.  In Sydney and running a ping from Japan to my home:

I'm on AussieBB, who are the best ISP I've used since early 2000's era Internode..>the internet speeds for most suck

At least in NZ we have kickass internet. 10Gbps residential here haha. Australian internet SUCKS.I didn't have time to read the whole post but I'm gonna share a few thoughts as a Perthian:

YouTuber RealLifeLore does excellent videos discussing things such as 'just how isolated is Australia' or the like (paraphrasing a little). One I recently watched was on I think it was Reykjavik become a trade central hub for Europe and US. Again - I may be misremembering things but I'm sure at some point in the in the first video he discussed the logistics of trade with AU. 

The combined population of NZ and AU is just 30 million. Compare this to the 330m in the US alone. Where I am in the most isolated city in the world  the are only 2 million. Pricing items to the market needs to both justify the costs of slugging items half way around the world by boat and it needs to be worth the effort. My Ltt waterbottle shipping was roughly 50% of the cost and had to divert through Germany.

Apologies if I missed a point somewhere but this was a bit rushed..Look, some things like the ROG Ally we're completely shafted on. It's $1,299 here, which is around a 20% markup even after converting the $699USD to just under $1,100 AUD, but ultimately It's economies of scale. 

There are cities in the US, Europe and Asia that have more people than our giant ass country, on an international scale we only have 3 population hotspots (4 if you wanna argue Perth's nearly 2mil counts), each at least 2 hours apart by plane does. On top of what's already been said about us having a weak economy & our dollar being like 65 cents, the logistics of moving stuff around in the country it are an absolute pain. The same stuff about logistics & population centres can be said for why our events are infrequent & poor quality. It sucks but idk, for most things the markup is only 10-15% above us prices once you convert them which is pretty reasonable when you consider how tough it is to get stuff over here & in the right places once it does get here.Right. 
Gigabyte oc 4080 America: 1269s or $2135 NZD
Gigabyte oc 4080 from pbtech in NZ, 2199nzd. 

Such a markup.25 Million people is nothing.
In germany we have states with 18mil.Apple products are more or less the same cost everywhere in the world. I‚Äôm in Taiwan and my dell work laptop and personal Apple laptop are more or less priced the same as NZ. Give or take depending on the exchange rate at the time you check."

Yes, if you search a loaded question, it is going to give you near matches. That‚Äôs kind of why the internet is both a gift and a curse. It gives you access to so much information, but it also gives stupid people access to misinformation to confirm their biases..Garbage in, garbage out..one streamer while playing dead island 2 asked alexa ""play piggy sounds"" and it played police sounds üíÄüíÄüíÄ.Alexa refuses to answer a lot of things the past while. And there's lot of wrong answers..The world is scary enough and it‚Äôs getting worse.Why is anyone still using those spy devices?.Wow, this thread really fired up the troglodytes.

Fines for these mega tech companies is merely like a slap on the wrist, and there's no accountability for illegal behaviours..Might as well drop the ‚Äúmillions‚Äù since it‚Äôs effectively $25 to them. And by the time I finished this comment they made that money back plus more.... if corporations are ""People"", let's start using the sentencing handed down in countries like Finland, where fines are set as a percentage of your income.   

A fine of $25 million is *not* a deterrence to Amazon, it is simply a cost of doing business.   

Amazon's Q1 2023 Revenue was $127.4 bn, Profit was $3.2 bn - I think a 20% fine levied against that $3.2 bn income - $640,000,000 - would encourage a change in behavior..that's what, like twelve seconds of AWS profits?.[deleted].That‚Äôs less than an hour of profit.

At some point in time it literally told us we were ‚ÄúOut of free answers‚Äù

Only ever ask it for the temperature now.Lmao rich people really are so damn out of touch with reality to think that we would use Alexa for buying stuff.So they‚Äôre not *losing* $10 billion, they‚Äôre not *getting* $10 billion that they felt entitled to..Never a better time to say ""Alexa, play Despacito"".This is so sad, let me play you a sad despacito on the worlds smallest alexa.There is a thing to consider, Amazon has and probably IS dumping a lot of money into infrastructure that allows Amazon Echo to work as it does. Which likely means thousands upon thousands of servers running at full pelt, using up a lot of energy, requiring hundreds of techs to maintain, and it's all being used to tell people about the weather. That is likely BILLIONS of Amazon's dollars being spent to tell people about the fucking weather.  


Now doesn't that make your smile a *little* wider?.This brings me joy because I'm getting sick of seeing a yellow ring for notifications and when I ask what it is, Alexa goes, ""Some shit you put in a cart once two years ago is on sale for $1.49 off. Would you like me to purchase it for you?""

Like wtf lol 

It also makes me laugh my ass off because one of the only things I ever use my Alexa for is for thunderstorm noises when I go to sleep. 

It *used to* only play like, a 30 minute clip. If I hadn't fallen asleep by then, I'd just ask it to restart.

But the last year or so, it plays a looping thunderstorm, nonstop until I tell it to stop. But then every now and then it'll ask me if I want the high quality, non looping, super long version purchase.

So reading this kinda cheers me up that the Alexa is literally taking the only thing I use it for and begging me to let it buy something, and then also just randomly begging me to let it buy something.

So if that's the case I will gladly switch to a normal Android TV and replace my sons FireTablet (which I installed Google Play Store onto).So we have come full circle with OSs from every manufacturer creating their own to everyone using Android to manufacturers building their in house again - Amazon, Xiaomi, Huawei, who's next?.[deleted].I'm sure this will definitely work and not be a discontinued service in a few years..Honestly I've never used an Amazon device that I haven't immediately written off as a laggy piece of eWaste trash so....

I would say redoing the OS would be beneficial but you already know with Amazon it's gonna be an ad fiesta..I'm sure people will throw away a full apps ecosystem for a new OS with 10-15 apps available at launch, just for Amazon... Bezos could treat his employees a little bit better instead of throwing money on garbage, but low chance for that..They have a partnership with Blackberry. Let‚Äôs start a rumour that they‚Äôre going to knock the dust off BB10 and use that..Android isn't terrible on these tablets, the way it's been customised  and tuned for Amazon's purposes makes it terrible.

Going solo on the OS is an expensive mistake waiting to happen..Wow, without the Play Store this thing will be DOA for many people"
2023-12-27,"They are pretty shit but there‚Äôs some things you can do to make them slightly less shit.

Use some kind of maintenance app like defsquid and run it routinely every few days. Also keep a few gigs free or it will slow it down considerably.  I know this is difficult especially with the ones with only 8gbs.
You can also run techdoctor or whatever it‚Äôs called, you can google it.  You can disable a bunch of Amazon services that run in the background, turn updates off etc‚Ä¶

For the remote issue if you have a keyboard laying around with usb that will work fine, I think even some usb game controllers work.

And yeah it‚Äôs annoying to find specific help for the TVs but generally most firestick guides should apply as it‚Äôs the same OS, pretty much just an internal stick in the tv. But yeah these aren‚Äôt the greatest devices.Can confirm. I will *never * buy a fire tv again. When we started using them, it opened quickly to our apps and media. Now it loads into a full screen ad, lags, refuses to load the HDMI menu for up to minutes of wait time, and 90% of the screen is ads or recommended content. Abysmal user experience..My biggest gripe is when I pause something, the tv goes to sleep before I know it. Then, I have to select a profile again and find my program and restart it. So annoying!!!.Bring back the dumb TVs!  The HDMI is for adding firetv, and all those other streaming devices.  They don't need to be embedded in a TV..For the record the performance problem has been happening with the sticks too lately, and I suspect it's for the same reason - updates.I got a 4K 44‚Äù firetv in September, I don‚Äôt know who makes it. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the tv, I like it. I have a region-free blue ray player hooked up to it too. The sound could be better I‚Äôve been thinking about a soundbar for it..I have Insignia Amazon fire tv on back deck. The second fire TV I have owned. Zero complaints works great.Lol no lie this happened to me and I called them out on Twitter and they sent me a free replacement despite being very much outside the return window

Didn't even ask for the old one back.Thank god I‚Äôm not the only one, i always thought my tv was a dud but its a little reassuring to see other people with the same experience. I bought a firestick not even a few hours after using the tv, just a frustrating lagfest..I (almost) got a qled omni 50in fire tv for Christmas. The first one delivered had the shipping label for some completely other address still attached and had obvious been opened/used. My parents had it replaced as there was still time before Christmas. Well fast forward to Christmas Day and I open the replacement. The box is still beat up a little but all the equipment is stored like it‚Äôs a new tv. I try and plug it in before doing anything else with it and lo and behold it has 2 cracks in the screen. Now fast forward to today (just a couple hours ago) I had a Samsung tv delivered instead because fate didn‚Äôt want me to have that fire tv.

I‚Äôm going to throw my cube in the garbage and get a generic Android TV box I can hack..Same thing happened to me too but fortunately you can technically disable it in settings (for now at least). The ads go full-screen when inactive but it doesn't autoplay video anymore and are static images..Can confirm, mine has done this over the last few weeks. Super annoying.

Although I've been told by a few employees from Amazon in Seattle that they believe this is a programming error with the cursor default position and that it wasn't intentional design. Only time will tell. Wouldn't be the first time they've missed something like this on a rushed update, but still assholish for letting it go to production..The update also basically bricked my stick. It still *technically* works but it went from being fine to now taking almost 3 minutes from the time I turn on the TV to when the ad loads, then it freezes on the ad, then it freezes whenever I try to open an app. In total it takes like 10 minutes to get to content..Well I‚Äôm never updating the one I have. I only have it bc I don‚Äôt want to let my plasma go.I immediately turn off its wifi connection and blacklisted it as soon as it started doing that..Every night when I'm falling asleep and I say ""Computer, turn off the TV"" now it plays a fucking loud ad instead and wakes the whole house up! What the fuck, Amazon!

Edit: on the phone with customer service now. I explained that a few days ago loud ads started playing upon starting my Fire TV. To troubleshoot this problem first they asked me to power cycle the device. I didn't want to argue so I humored them and did it. Still ads.Next step they asked me to turn off ""interest based ads"". Surprisingly that didn't remove ads all together lol. So now they told me they are researching the solution because they only had these two ideas that they were told these would get rid of the ads (???).So it's been 30 mins, I'm curious what they come up with. I'll report back once I have an actual solution.

Edit 2: the customer service representative got back to me and said that to ""\[their\] surprise this is also happening on \[their\] device in the office"". And that upon further research this is indeed part of the latest patch and is rolled out to all Amazon devices, and there is no going back. Now I asked for a refund on my devices as I don't accept advertisements in my home. They are all 3-5 years old so I'm pretty sure I'm SOL, but it sounds like this is the end of the Alexa ecosystem in my home.

Edit 3: Just finished the call, of course no refunds after these years. Their last suggestion was to turn off video and audio auto play in the settings, which they confirmed this patch automatically turned on. Turning this off just switches the videos out for full screen static ads. They forwarded the negative feedback and recommended more people call and complain about this change as the representative themselves was upset about this lol..Arrr me hearties. I hear the sea calling me back..This is the bad place.I‚Äôd always been annoyed by how they always pushed Alexa on the photos screensaver but switched to an Apple TV after they started playing ads. I‚Äôd drop Prime too if it weren‚Äôt for the Whole Foods benefits, they‚Äôre always pushing you to lump or delay deliveries‚Ä¶ which is good for the environment I guess but sort of negates the original value of Amazon Prime."
2023-11-09,"If you can't side load apps, Amazon will put out the fire on fire tv..Nooooooo. This will make it more difficult to remove bloatware and other annoyances from the device. It also may make sideloading a thing of the past..And that will be the end of Fire TV.

Streaming Sites do NOT want to spend more time and money to make an app for Apple,  Xbox, PS, LG, Roku, Samsung, Android and Samsung.   (Did I miss any?).[deleted].Look, all you companies that want webOS, just license f'ing webOS from LG already!.Walmart is about to sell a ton of Onn devices..Welp, it was good while it lasted. Onn is making great $20 units anyway..Firesticks will be sitting on Amazon's shelf rotting...buh bye firestick!!.Amazon: We‚Äôre going to change our awful OS that no one wants to develop for to an even worse OS that even less people will develop apps for..Looks like my Firestick 4K Max will be the last Fire TV device I'll ever get

If I can't install apks their devices will be no use to me"
2023-12-24,"No one outside Amazon knows what their plans are for VegaOS. It may well be limited to their Echo devices where you couldn't side load apps anyway, sort of like Google did with their Fuschia OS. Even if they are planning on using it for everything, there's no way they'd start releasing devices with it until it had apps like Netflix and Hulu available for it and an app store. It's possible they'll get rid of side loading, but there's no way they'd walk away from the revenue of in-app purchase cuts from an app store.

The reason I'd be concerned about the future of FireTV devices is because of Amazon's ramming ads down your throat. When your customers have other options, arguably better ones, and you keep kicking them in the teeth, eventually they're going to leave..I'm fully invested in Amazon fire sticks but they just keep trying to make me sour.  It could be so much better, hell now they even made it so it boots with the ads full screen.  My recast hasn't been updated in ages either which is frustrating.  Thinking of going to Roku and hdhomerun but I hate the idea of fully switching ecosystems.Nope.  I'll keep using it as long as it is useful to me, and when that changes I'll go use something else.  *shrug*.I had an Amazon Recast for a few years but once they announced they were discontinuing it, I decided to move away from Amazon devices.  When I needed to upgrade my streaming device, I went with a new Roku and only kept my firestick for the Recast.  Once the new Tablo 4th gen came out, I didnt need the firestick or Recast anymore.  I think Amazon would rather fire rocketships into outer space..It will only be new devices......stop panicking.I think it's aimed at Web centric devices like smart cameras and thermostats. I doubt they're going to get the developer support for Vega to threaten the Fire market..Still too early to be concerned.  Have to see what ""actually"" happens..Im going to keep buying until they actually make the change.. hopefully I can have the newest one that still runs on android.  I do actually prefer roku but the better amazon devices are so much cheaper than Roku on prime day / black friday..I think we‚Äôll have years to think about it..Amazon just got into patent problems.  This could be just about avoiding additional patent issues/costs.  Even if they move OS's they will have to have an android emulator running on the OS."
2023-10-22,"Reinstalling the YouTube app didn't fix the problem for me :( I even updated my Fire Stick, but that didn't help either! I'm not sure what's wrong...  


I ended up using screen sharing from my iPhone to watch videos on the TV. I found 2 good apps, DoCast and AirBeam, that work pretty well with Fire Stick.  


But, I still want to fix the YouTube problem so I can watch videos directly on the TV.Same problem here. I even went so far as to factory reset the firestick but the problem persists. Just curious though, what do you mean by Amazon killed it. I assume you mean its a tech issue to be resolved, not that you have some information that they permanently killed it like they did with the Spectrum app over a contract dispute..Same here. YT not working on Fire TV Stick. Was working just fine yesterday evening. Woke up this morning and the app is unable to connect.

I really do hope this is temporary. YouTube is effectively all I watch.

UPDATE: Looks like the YouTube app on the fireTV Stick is now working again..Same issue here. Woke up this morning and tried to open up YouTube on our fire stick, and we kept getting the 'can't connect' message. It worked perfectly fine yesterday. Hoping whatever is causing this issue is resolved quickly, as YouTube is what we mainly watch in our home..Me too. Everything else works on firestick and youtube works on everything else. Thanks a lot Amazon. Now I have to get another chrome cast since I gave mine away. I use youtube as my TV which is why I pay for it. Amazon has now interrupted that service without any warning or notice. I'm frustrated/:.Yep it's not working on my Amazon smart TV, it's not working on my Amazon fire tablet, it's not working on amazon fire sticks, everything else works fine and YouTube is working on every other device I have that is not Amazon. So something is going on and I cannot believe everybody isn't talking about this. But I can't find anything about it online.YT not working on my Firestick. All other apps work fine. Other Firestick works fine. I reset Firestick to no avail. I deleted YT app and tried to download and reinstall. It says ‚Äúcan‚Äôt connect , please try again‚Äù. Network works fine. Speedtest work fine through Firestick. Never seen this happen..Sounds like Google pushed a bad update. YouTube TV updated last night too. No issues on my FireTV. I know you‚Äôre being dramatic on purpose but blame the right soulless tech monster. Lol.Same problem here. Canadian location. YT stopped working on all my fire tv sticks yesterday. Now I'm stuck watching on my phone until they fix this. Bah!.I just deleted the Youtube app from my fire stick and re-downloaded it again.  Google offered me an updated version of the app and after signing back in IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!"
2023-12-03,"What's the best streaming stick? I've been meaning to replace my fire stick for a bit as it's starting to lag..It‚Äôs almost like they sell these at cost because we‚Äôre the actual product that‚Äôs being sold to advertisers. ü§î.this is why i love my apple tv just  super fast simple ui and zero ads.Is it talking about the TV sticks? because I have one and it doesn't do that, I'm in UK.Chromecast with Google TV 4k are pretty good from my experience..More overreaction.  Just go to settings  > preferences > features content > turn off ""allow video autoplay"". Then go back to using your fire tv.

Fire Stick/TV is still fine. Spend your energy on something else..Replaced mine with an Apple TV 4K, no ads is amazing.Isn't it amazing how you buy things for full price for hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars and they decide the best thing to do is cram shitty ads down your eye sockets?.Amazon tv's are so over-priced for the quality they are too, last i looked at one....Change the loader and the problem goes away."
2023-11-09,"Not enough room for more ADS in their devices?.Cool. Even more of a reason to not buy their products..If it's true .then I suppose they'll sell a lot less devices and therefore less subscriptions..  people can just buy Chromecast with google TV or an android tv box.  Which is what I'd do anyways even.So if someone finds a way to install kodi for Linux on this will be the alternative.weird move..So it‚Äôs future fire stick right? I don‚Äôt wake up one day and my dodgy IPTV with all sports channels won‚Äôt go missing ?.They basically sign their own death warrant if they don't run Android.Good timing now that the Raspberry Pi 5 is out and prices are coming close to retail again.

I bought a fire TV for my setup and had to do all kinds of work around because it kept running out of space.  Never had the problem back when I used a Pi 3. I was not as seamless, but it I never ran out of room..And here I was looking to get the new Cube, even made a post! So I guess it‚Äôs the aging Shield..What are they going to replace it with?"
2023-11-24,"I already have a TMOHI line. If I add a new line, am I still considered a new customer?.I've never seen a TV so large! How do you all have enough room in your house for a 50 foot tv?.Where it allows you to enter promo code on the Tmobile website?.I just submitted 23Firetv promo code and ordered home internet for $35. Will I still get the TV later?.Good luck with this. I was supposed to get the Amazon device with the screen. That was over a year ago. To this day, still haven't qualified or received it. Tmo says sorry, can't help..Do they enforce the service address? It‚Äôs not available for me but it is for my brother thinking of signing up using his address and using it at my house?.Ah balls. I just ordered my home Internet Wednesday..How do you enter apartment number?.I'd do it for the free tv but the service isn't available in my area....boooo nothing for old customers and i cant cancel and re-sign because they no longer have unlimited tmhi available at my address or any around me lol"
2023-11-09,"So they are moving from a platform built on Linux to a different platform built on Linux..Fire tv products are already dog shit and slow. How will this possibly improve performance‚Ä¶..I wonder what percentage of their users load up the Google Play Store?   I guess not enough to matter..So as of 2023 - is the Nvidia Shield Pro still the go-to device?.Another reason I won't be getting an Amazon Fire anytime soon..Im guessing they don't like keeping up with Android security updates. But prohibiting power users from using other Android apps doesn't seem worth it. sincerely, a power user.RupeThereItIs reportedly ditching Fire TV..So they want a move closed system that can't be utilized in a lot of it's current ways.  Closer in execution to Roku..gtk... i stopped buying their shyt last year  
when so many were getting update bricked.  
very happy with onn 4k 2023 as a substitute..Rather surprising.   They lose a lot moving off of Android.   A big one is the tooling.

But I can't see how this would ever be a positive?"
2023-08-28,"We taxpayers subsidize it. We really do need to vote for politicians that will end corporate welfare. It‚Äôs not just Amazon, companies like Walmart have a large amount of employees on government assistance that costs billions while they take in billions more in profit. 

When I say I want to see universal healthcare in the US, and people argue they don‚Äôt want to raise taxes, me either, I want to start with ending corporate welfare. Stop privatizing profits and socializing losses..Why isn‚Äôt anyone investigating who signed the contracts and why?.It is also literally destroying the Post Office. Losing money, ridiculous turnover, ludicrous over time. FedEx and UPS can cut them off, but USPS can't..Partially correct, but it is not a Amazon - USPS contract. The rate was defined by other factors. Outfits like Alibaba, DHGate, etc are also bleeding USPS under the same conditions..Why blame Amazon? The lesson of your story is that the USPS needs better managers and lawyers involved in writing contracts with customers..Kind of sucks for me too.  I work for a major US airline that has a USPS contract to ship mail.  It used to just be the flat letter boxes, the green top boxes and the occasional bag of mail, not that bad really.

Now it is just constant bags of small packages, mostly from Amazon.  Those Amazon boxes such too, always falling apart..Are we really sure USPS is losing money on flat rate package delivery?.That‚Äôs one reason we (FedEx) dropped Amazon as a customer. They were also poaching execs (good riddance, AFAIC), and dumping their rural (least profitable) deliveries on us..A large portion of Amazon packages are delivered by Amazon branded delivery station partners run by a third party contractor. Also, Amazon itself loses money on free delivery, each package costs the company about $5 to ship..In Canada, which has a tenth of the population of the US on a much larger territory, Canada Post nevertheless rakes in 2-3 $billion profits every year for the federal government (that‚Äôs this much taxes we pay less).

Clearly, the USPS is badly managed‚Ä¶"
2023-08-08,"A friend of mine who has CDL driving experience went to Amazon to interview about delivery driving and was informed of the same.  They have ""Delivery Service Partners"", basically like franchises that hire/fire and pay the drivers. I don't know any more details than that..How absolutely vile. Does Amazon not realize that without it's drivers they would be completely useless? All of the products they sell and warehouses full of expensive machinery and thousands of employees are all useless if the package can't get to the door, and lord knows USPS doesn't have the capacity to pick up those deliveries.Bezos: Our drivers aren't employees.

Anyone with eyeballs: It says ""Amazon"" on the fucking truck Jeff..It's a horrendous dynamic that corporate is allowed to use the labor of people and at the same time work the game to be able to claim people aren't ""employees""

End misclassification.Amazon gets around a ton of delivery driver labor laws and mail delivery regulations simply by not being registered as a delivery service. That's why they can't actually put anything in your mailbox or apartment package lockers and just toss shit at your door. Once this nonsense loophole gets fixed, they're going to be in serious trouble in the best way possible since they've now crested this infrastructure they will have to keep..Be a shame if Amazon drivers just started dumping boxes in the middle of the road..Eat the rich‚Ä¶‚Ä¶start with Jeff Bezos ü§°.That's a hashtag I could get behind.FYI it's Andy Jassy at the head of Amazon now, Bezos has been out of the picture for a while - too busy playing spaceman.  


Doesn't excuse what Bezos did, but Jassy is the one doubling-down. It'll end up killing the company most likely (as an employee, it's like watching a slow motion car wreck), but he doesn't give a shit, he'll still get his payout..Bezos hasnt been the amazon ceo for like two years lol. hes just living it up on the stock price increases."
2023-09-05,"This is the sad part..
Testing down instead of dismantling so most materials can be repurposed.Why am I not surprised that somehow Amazon is involved..Did they own the property for 12 years and now are tearing it down or did they buy a property and started swinging.Oh, does that hurt.  Beautiful, top of the line buildings too.  The only good thing is, at least it wasn't in a wilderness area destroying rare plants and wildlife..Amazon is an unlimited profit-maximizing entity. It will ultimately attempt to dismantle and rebuild everything in the universe in order to improve the metrics it interprets as profits..I'm pretty sure reddit uses AWS, so this post is one of the many reasons why they needed a new datacenter :).You can't reuse the building for an Amazon/Google grade datacenter. If it were a generic mid tier datacenter, maybe, but for a high tier 99.99% uptime datacenter, you need a purpose built building.

Amazon has no choice here. You think thry wouldn't jump at the chance to not spend money on a new building if they could?.Progresses..  
einst√ºrzende neubauten.Wow, what a waste of a perfectly good building. I assume a data center looks more like a warehouse and this is easier and structurally safer than removing all those beams and walls inside each room."

The current one is dumb as a brick..The competition speeds up, Gemini is in the pipeline and we still wait for apple. Oh and don‚Äôt we forget Llama 3 soon. So exciting.We always need more competition.[deleted].Accelerate!.Bearish. Amazon doesn‚Äôt have solid product sense and has gotten by for far too long on the basis of volume. They are unpleasant to use and have not built their brand on quality..This is awesome. I actually think the data amazon has could really create a different kind of LLM.

2023-09-25,"E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon‚Äôs aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet‚ÄôsGoogle.

Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude chatbots.

The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.

Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks. 

This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia‚Äôs key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia‚Äôs stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.

To an extent, Amazon‚Äôs deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic‚Äôs AI models via Amazon Bedrock ‚Äî a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.

Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.

Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft‚Äôs multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.

Questions:

1)  Has Nvidia's internal R&D compute needs become so big that it can't handle it internally and must offload to third parties like Amazon?  What the hell could they be working on?

2)  Most of the new deployment announcents, here and from recent supercomputer conference, seem to include Grace Hopper cpu-gpu combinations.  Are future sales moving away from DGX systems (with 8 to 1 gpu/cpu ratios) to more GH systems (with 1 to 1 gpu/cpu ratios)?

2023-11-08,"Aukaat of Flipkart vs Amazon India 
Flipkart aka Fraudkart - 
Wanted to share my experience (with pics) with flipkart & many others who r experiencing it every day . 
How Flipkart hires a lawyer to defend themselves of Frauds they do & even point finger at you (customer) that you r trying to harass Flipkart with mal intention . This is how they value their customers . 

This is what happens when fraud happens on Flipkart in contrast to Amazon .

I got a slip instead of ‚Çπ2899 CD & return policy was not an option on dis product . So when i tried to contact Flipkart Customer support .. only an AI machine was there to attend me & that machine repeatedly kept on saying that this product is received & you cannot return it . As it was just a machine .. i cudnt even explain my situation . Then i tried to give a review on this product warning other buyers about this seller which did not get published . Then what i noticed is that on this popular product .. very few reviews were present & all were positive. So even reviews on Flipkart are fake & if someone tries to give real feedback .. it gets ignored to SAFEGUARD fraud that's happening on their website . 

COURT CASE-

after few months  i filed a case against Flipkart .. i got call from someone working in Flipkart saying that we need some proof & all other stuff in order to come to conclusion that me as customer is not lying . I said that i already posted review with pics but ur website didn't published it ... in reply he says that review may not be according to our policy .. 
I asked them if only positive reviews come under their policy ..? he didn't know how to reply to that . 
So in court instead of refunding me ‚Çπ2899.. they hired a lawyer who prepared papers which says that me as a customer is trying to harass Flipkart by false charging . It was also written that whatever happens on Flipkart website is not a responsibility of Flipkart at all . 
So are we as customers r fool to trust Flipkart as brand wen they don't even care what's goin on their website .
I cud hv continued this case but hassle of going to court & fighting this giant Fraudsters was not something i thought is worth for . See this is not about getting 2800‚Çπ back .. it's about fighting against such fraud companies who treat their customers like trash.

AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE- 

At last i wud like to tell How Amazon have dedicated teams to help u through ..in such situations . As one of their product didn't get deliver to me but it was marked as delivered on website .. i contacted them .. explained de situation .. they said give us 3 days .. our team will investigate on this matter if it was a mistake from seller or courier .. after 3 days they refunded me full amount . Usually i don't experience such things on Amazon . i hv bought multiple items from Amazon till now but i bought 4 items from #Flipkart & 2 out of them were frauds & they also harass u for using their website ."

This transition is going to happen fast..Why do they blink? lol.10s of Millions will be without work in the near future.

These companies need to be shackled but government corruption and the seduction of capitalism are hard to resist.

Any comoany with real potential for competition gets bought out. Any threats can be subdued with a willingness to price out the competition with discounts/losses until they fold.

How can we allow a company to be a social media network, streaming network, supermarket, clothing store, delivery service, server provider, manufacturer, etc, company. And don't even get me started on the data they're gathering and what they're doing with itm

 They buy out the competition.

An honest government not corrupted by money would've put the shackles on these companies.

WGA should have focused on streaming residuals and viewership transparency instead of dying on that writers room minimum staffing hill..It‚Äôs over, Amazon is finished.[deleted].It's hard to picture any Hollywood organization as an underdog.Honestly, these feel like two wildly unrelated things

Bullshit! It's just another income stream to raise their bottom line..I‚Äôm so fucking tired of being charged extra for what i already have *and the content keeps getting worse*..God this is getting ridiculous..I wish they'd take some money off my prime sub and keep the video stuff to themselves.Literally no consumer wants this.These companies are doing everything they can to try to force ads back into being the norm because it generates them more revenue. 

I will go back to reading by candlelight before I watch ads/commercials regularly. 

The fact the previous generations PAID for a service their entire lives where they were forced to watch ads constantly in-between all their programming is insane. I will always do the ad free option, but I fear that option's days are numbered..Amazon made over 225 BILLION in profits last year, and they still think prime video needs ads.   

Greedy bastards.I've been unsubscribing from more and more streaming services now. I figure if I want to see a new movie I can always pay the $3 or $4 to just rent it. And for TV shows...I guess I'll just skip most of them..Keep going streaming services, you‚Äôre doing everything you can for me to justify going back into the high seas, and not feel bad about it.

That‚Äôs like an airplane in a constant rate of climb and acceleration that never runs out of fuel.  

Carl Sagan would slap you in the head for suggesting it. 

Amazon is on its way to becoming eBay. Selling counterfeit Chinese goods, having them returned and palletized for sale at some corner store that popped up in your neighborhood.

There is a doomsdays clock in some basement closet that Jeff bezos knew about. That‚Äôs why he took the money and ran.

Amazon is a destroyer to companies abroad family small can‚Äôt compete its just not right at all..I heard it will still take 4-5 hours to buy and they will force you to buy undercarriage treatment to reduce rust..Amazon is a pretty bad company - they‚Äôll just collect data on what cars everyone buys, then produce their own Amazon Basics car, sell it at an ungodly low price to squeeze the competition out. Once the competition dies, they‚Äôll jack up the price. There won‚Äôt be any choice in the market left.

1. This is all pretty standard language for a credit agreement. 

2. The reason is was included now  is because it was amended during the period so they could transition to Daily Simple SOFR (vs LIBOR) for loan pricing. The deadline for transition was around June.

3. Joint Ventures are pretty common. GME IMX LRC are seemingly in one of those relationships already, but they don‚Äôt control an entity. 

I don‚Äôt have the time, but an interesting exercise would be to go through the negative covenants section to see what is permitted now vs in the original credit agreement that was filed 11/4/21. If there are any material changes that could indicate what GME has an appetite for, you‚Äôll find them there. If it is generally unchanged, I wouldn‚Äôt think too much on it. üöÄ.FYI for reference, Mitsubishi operates as a Horizontal Keiretsu.

2023-10-16,"Phase Three having by far the smoothest production of any phase makes so much sense, since its easily the single phase with the best consistency in terms of quality.

EDIT

>No Way Home basically never had a finished screenplay because so many elements were in flux. Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and Sally Field‚Äôs Aunt May were all in various drafts. Maguire and Garfield weren‚Äôt signed until two months into filming.

Everything about No Way Home's production really does make it seem like the biggest miracle Marvel Studios ever pulled off even more so then Endgame or the original Avengers..>Don Cheadle was at his kid‚Äôs birthday party when a Marvel executive called, giving him an hour to decide whether to be War Machine. When he said he was in the middle of laser tag, the executive replied, ‚ÄúOh! Oh, take two hours.‚Äù

I read that exec's reply in the most sarcastic/faux-friendly voice possible lol.

Thanks for compiling all of this!.The part about the 2020 Disney investors day sticks out for me the most. It explains so much about the last 3 years..Ike Perlmutter still sounds like piece of shit.""but also meant Feige didn‚Äôt perform much oversight over the TV shows. ""

![gif](giphy|AdHMAm2Zxz1p2tViKX).Phase one:   None of this is suprising, Iron Man 1 and 2 were put together by the seat of their pants and didn't have finished scripts for either when they started filming.  So the fact that ANY interconnectiveness was accidental is not shocking.  

The fact that the actual reason Runaways got cancelled being because they couldn't merchandise it completely tracks.  Marvel as a company has been following the Star Wars model of mkaing their profit off the licensing than the actual film..So many juicy morsels.


So just some of them:

- I know Feige is no longer the golden boy (justifiably, I mean ""Feige was incensed after Alonso criticized Chapek for not denouncing Florida‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äù bill, breaking Kevin‚Äôs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt air dirty laundry in public‚Äù rule. Feige speculated if she‚Äôd ‚Äúoutgrown‚Äù her role."")  but still, Fuck Ike.


- Whatever happened with Feige and Norton must be bigger than just big creative differences, if Wright, or Derrickson are not on that list, only ""actual abuser"" Joss Whedon.>The MCC noted the hell out of Ant-Man, clumsily shoehorning in MCU references, which Wright and Cornish tried to make work.

This hurts a lot. Perhaps we could have gotten a still MCU reference and everything Edgar Wright film if it wasn't because the counsel was rushing things..I just feel bad for Brie Larson. I always think back to that interview she did at D23 in 2022 with Variety or something where the reporter asked about more Captain Marvel and she said something along the lines of does anyone even want me back? People weren‚Äôt sure if she was being serious back then but it‚Äôs pretty clear all the hate has gotten to her. And she doesn‚Äôt deserve it. She‚Äôs a really good actress and the first Captain Marvel didn‚Äôt give her a ton of stuff to work with. Hopefully even if it doesn‚Äôt do great at the box office the Marvels will be reviewed well and she‚Äôll finally get some love..>Feige was incensed after Alonso criticized Chapek for not denouncing Florida‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äù bill, breaking Kevin‚Äôs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt air dirty laundry in public‚Äù rule.

One of the only times Alonso refused a request from the higher-ups was removing LGBTQ references in Quantumania for release in certain countries.

2023-07-23,"So what I'm hearing is when my impatient ass dumps ice cubes into my coffee along with all the flavored creamer and sugar so I can shotgun it and get my brain going 3.5 minutes sooner, I'm actually an *artisanal creator* practicing *important coffee science*..The most litigious people when it comes to their ""original idea"" are those whose one idea wasn't original to start with. 

I made a submission to hobbyscuffles last week about Kikay (jewelry designer) doing something similar. 

I also work in screenwriting and the people who are the most worried about someone stealing their ""million dollar idea"" are those who only have one idea and usually aren't great at executing it anyway..This post had everything I need in a story, legal concepts, humour and something to learn along the way.

I never asked or sought to know what cold brew coffee is because I always sense I would get a walking headache personified as the response.

By reading your sub drama gossip, I actually learnt something, and in an enjoyable way.

The legal context was just a bonus.

10/10.> The intention was to establish a dialogue before you start production to assist where possible in complying with any legal aspects related to patents that our company also needs to abide by, before bringing products like this to market.

You know, that thing corporations totally do where their founders contact people making stuff at home with their 3D printers to act as a *friendly guiding hand* in product development that simply wants to collaborate in avoiding infringement.

You know how you make a hamburger for your food truck and share it on Instagram, and McDonald's COO Chris Kempczinski privately sends you a bunch of legal documents to let you know they love your burger and wanna collab on making your burger *not* infringe on the McDouble? That normal thing that happens?.Uh-oh, and here I was thinking that a French press, while fairly cheap, was considered on the fancier end of coffee making at home. I thought it was a step up from a basic coffee pot, but maybe it‚Äôs just that I have to grind the beans fresh before I use it? Didn‚Äôt know people think of it on the same level as instant coffee, lol..I once told a coffee enthusiast that I don't like coffee, and just prefer the starbucks style sugary frappes and stuff like that, and he looked at me like I'd pissed on his wife. There's such a profound shift in how people interact with something once they get Into It, it's really fascinating..First of all, the coffee sub is...wretched. Secondly, based on what I've gleaned from that hellscape, this is all too real.Me who owns more coffee brewing methods than is probably sane: oh god the coffee people are at it again.

Like I have a favorite roast and blend, a preferred method (V60 pour over), and a favorite method (Siphon baybeeeee) but some people spend too much time on coffee than is safe.

James Hoffman is about the limit of what I call ""sane"" in the hobby, and he gets a pass to try even more stuff because he owns his own roaster that sends product all over the world.

Plus it allows Hames Joffman to come in with the funny edits later..Man, and here I am, unknowingly outraging someone because I use the pour-over method. (3 bucks at the most from Daiso, best money you'll ever spend.).Wait, I feel like these people are all on some totally new level of coffee snobbery that I've never encountered before. I don't drink coffee myself (except like once a month as a migraine cure), but I swear every coffee drinker I know thinks that instant coffee is an abomination, but considers a French press to be as respectable as drip coffee. Am I tripping? Or are they just like ""only espresso is valid""?

This makes me wanna get whiskey stones tho. I hate how long it takes my tea to cool down to be drinkable."

Now as year end evals are hitting, they're being told based on your last six months of not coming in, you're not getting promoted.

Even if Amazon‚Äôs content was all A24 caliber, these issues make me rarely use their streaming apps..250 million for Citadel for only 1 season???

 I've never even heard of it..Genuine question, is there any way something like Rings of Power would have ever been able to make back its absurd costs? By all accounts, Rings of Power hasn't done great, but even if it had been beloved, would that have made them their money back? With something like DVD/Blu-Ray sales and TV viewings I can understand how they'd make it back, but how does that work with streaming? (It's an actual question as i've never really understood how a show like this could end up making profit when it's basically streaming only)..I don't watch Amazon anything because the explosions are volume 10000 and the dialog is volume 0.2.Honestly, I believe one of the ***biggest*** reason they're having issues with audiences.  


Their atrocious wait time between seasons. People don't stick around for additional seasons because they forget it even exists.  


Releasing a new episode every week is all well and good, if you have other shows to fill out the rest of the week... and you can't just release them all on Friday.

You need Serials. Sitcoms, Procedurals like CSI/Law and Order. Something to keep people actually turning prime video on every day of the week beyond just Thursday/Friday nights when their new episodes drop..Meanwhile, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, the show that put Prime on the map in a big way and was possibly their biggest hit (top 10 Nielsen ratings and multiple Emmy noms and wins) wasn‚Äôt even mentioned in the article and had it‚Äôs possible 6th season pulled so Prime could pay for Orcs and the overpriced and badly received Citadel..Because they‚Äôre making Fallout tv series.""Look, guys, I understand we own 60% of the internet and are easily a trillion dollar company, but you guys need to cool it over there"""

Even The Rings of Power ($400 million-plus), a show that attracted a large audience, failed to hold on to most of its viewers over the course of the season, according to The Hollywood Reporter.


> **No show illustrates Amazon‚Äôs liberal spending better than Citadel, a global spy thriller that cost more than $250 million for one season.** Despite being one of the most expensive series in TV history, Citadel has failed to chart as one of the 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US in any week since it debuted, according to Nielsen.

Quite a shitty way to proceed, particularly when the result is such a disaster..Didn't they give Phoebe Waller-Bridge insane amount of money to develop something and she came up with nothing so far?

Besides that i can‚Äôt think of many great TV-shows on Prime Video..Is this why that lord of the rings show is now shooting on a soundstage in London?.Fuck it. They already canceled The Expanse. They can‚Äôt hurt me any more..In my opinion, I think the failure of a lot of the series on streaming services for the last few years is a result of what the writers guild is striking for. The companies have been squeezing the writing staff for every last nickel. Shorter periods in the writer‚Äôs room, not having the writers on set, not having the writers working with the editing process and basically keeping them under intense stress worrying about their careers and financial health.

2023-08-30,"Quiet layoff that is what this is. No one is forcing anyone to work there..I stopped going in months ago. Was a waste of time and money. Then I quit. Last day is Friday. Not worth getting upset over. It‚Äôs just a job at a company that is now just another tech company, without the perks..The RTO isn't so much the issue amongst employees now, it's the relocation that really showed their hand and disdain for their employees. Telling associates who were already working from office to move to a new ""hub"" (which is completely arbitrary in many cases) or being forced to ""voluntarily resign"" if they refuse. And the relocation package is less than $7k, barely enough for a moving van so things like closing costs are all on you. They also went back on hired virtual tags pre and post pandemic which was in hiring contract.

I would move for a job, but I would never move for a job I already have. Especially since Amazon could just say you're laid off as soon as you move to the new city and have completely shown they would be willing to do that..This is only a ploy to keep their real estate investments viable. Nothing more than that. It‚Äôs not about productivity or the employees..I wouldn‚Äôt mind as much if they didn‚Äôt also say they were moving my teams office to Bellevue next year..‚Äúpast the time to disagree and commit‚Äù ‚Ä¶ disagree and commit is about business decisions not working conditions..I'm sure the engineers will get new jobs without too much problem..Fully remote and hybrid companies are hiring at faster rates. (See Atlassian and others)

I don't think it's 'going to work out' for Amazon, regardless of their attrition approach..For any company, if profits and revenue is up, and production hasn‚Äôt dropped, there is zero reason for going back to the office unless there‚Äôs a financial reason they aren‚Äôt telling us..I don't mind the office so much because I do enjoy the banter, and having two people work from home can become awkward, but if my wife's job said we need you to start coming into the office she would say ""so, who should I work for now?"""
2023-07-05,"The first fucking question out my mouth as CEO would have been ""why did we spend all that money on a built in audience only to then give them all the finger?"".>Despite being one of the most expensive series in TV history, Citadel has failed to chart as one of the 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US in any week since it debuted, according to Nielsen.

I'd never heard of Citadel before reading this article..Why do I feel the answer is going to be the money is laundered or they used it for political donations or drugs..Some interesting points:

> In recent weeks, he has asked executives for detailed budget analyses of some of their biggest shows, according to people familiar with the matter, scrutinizing the studio‚Äôs ballooning costs and mixed track record with audiences.

> Last year, Amazon spent $7 billion on original shows, licensed programs and sports, up from $5 billion the year before. Only Netflix and Disney spend more on streaming

> In the past nine months, Amazon has released at least a half-dozen pricey series that failed to deliver huge audiences. Daisy Jones & the Six, The Power, Dead Ringers and The Peripheral all cost more than $100 million to produce but failed to crack Nielsen‚Äôs list of the 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US. Even The Rings of Power ($400 million-plus), a show that attracted a large audience, failed to hold on to most of its viewers over the course of the season, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

> No show illustrates Amazon‚Äôs liberal spending better than Citadel, a global spy thriller that cost more than $250 million for one season. Despite being one of the most expensive series in TV history, Citadel has failed to chart as one of the 10 most-watched streaming programs in the US in any week since it debuted, according to Nielsen. It did hit the top 10 among streaming originals for a week, coming in just behind Netflix Inc.‚Äôs Barbecue Showdown.

> Even Salke‚Äôs biggest supporters acknowledge Citadel hasn‚Äôt panned out as intended. The show started not with a creative idea but as a business premise. Salke wanted a global series that could take place in multiple locations and lead to country-specific spinoffs.

> After a recent trip to Seattle, where Amazon is based, Salke told her staff that her bosses had ""raved"" about the performance of the studio‚Äôs team. Yet even as Jassy voices his ""support"", he wants to know where all the money is going..They should hire someone outside their wokeness bubble to help them make TV shows for normal people..Oh so now that Henry cavill is going to make a wahammer show, they are suddenly concerned with spending? Fuck them. It's fine if that feminist bitch spends 1 billion dollars to rape the corpse of LOTR right? This people suck so hard.Ask every Hollywood studio about their big spending. Why are they bloating budgets so much when they know it makes earning a profit harder?.Studio: Spending lots of money to appeal to 10% of audiences who generally are too poor or too anti-consumerist to actually watch is a great idea!.Just don‚Äôt cancel Reacher or The Terminal List, you assholes.

It‚Äôs another thing when the over paid CEO is actively trying to hurt employees. The cherry on top is them admitting they have no proof that their claims of RTO are actually beneficial to the company, employees, or really anyone else.

These handful of CEOs and their lackeys are showing how little business acumen they really have..Every time someone in management talks about how work won't get done without their employees commuting to an office and sitting 8 hours at a desk, I think of that line from Blazing Saddles: ""We've got to protect our phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen."".My entire company is home based and we are hitting revenue and profit targets. I do have data to back it up, and its fine..Source: Pressure from every last local politician everywhere who is now getting it up their ass from every local business centered around generating income from daily business commuters; essentially, it's all been somewhat of an artificially created market that is now suffering from a lack of subsidized welfare that used to come from all our paychecks before WFH..He‚Äôs lying if he says there‚Äôs no data. There‚Äôs data. There‚Äôs always performance date in any company that size. Down to the smallest detail. What there *isn‚Äôt*, quite obviously, is data that supports his position..

If a dumbass manager gets that level of coaching, it‚Äôs terrifying to think how prepared are one and two step up..Share this, speak about it, make it known.

Workers need to organize, or we will always be overpowered and taken advantage of by the corporate elite (greed)..I mean, companies that embrace remote work are going to suck up any talented employees who decide to leave Amazon.

2023-10-20,"Layoffs without having to pay the severance. So hot right now. All the companies are doing it..‚ÄúYou better move back to the city to work here, even though we may fire you randomly along with thousands of other employees.‚Äù

- All of Seattle‚Äôs tech companies.A year and a half ago I had Amazon recruiters viciously chasing after me to hire me, promising up and down that they would never make me move to an area with an Amazon office, and remote was forever. I would be furious if I had believed them back then.

Edit: Some of ya'll haven't worked in a right to work state, and it shows

Edit 2: yes, everyone who asked if I meant at will is correct, I just can't reply to all of you, lol.This is why any stipulation like permanent WFH as a condition of accepting an offer needs to be written down in your signed employment contract, with no wiggle room for the company to unilaterally change things. Recruiter promises are not worth anything..FYI, this has nothing at all to do with business productivity or work output

The city of Seattle offered Amazon significant incentives to get them to bring 50,000 employees back into the downtown economy.

The first week they were back in office  the area around the Amazon HQ reported 100% increase in point of sale transactions and parking fees.

Amazon is getting incentives from the city, paid for by the employees in both commuting time, and actual dollars spent.[removed].I have worked at Amazon since 2009. Morale is incredibly low and the stress has never been higher. It is not fun at all. 

It used to be a place where I would learn every day. Where I would invent every day. I would get new ideas and try new tech every single day. Now it just feels like everyone is trying to keep their heads above the water..What if someone does show up that they wanted to fire? Do they just fire them anyway.The AWS team was trying to get me to work on one of the experimental DS teams in June of last year with the promise being permanent remote work. I shot them down because I've heard horror stories about how their awful WLB. Seeing this, I couldn't be more happy that I said no..The problem is that this is obviously a stealth layoff.  Amazon stock is only up 6% from a year ago so they need more people to leave.

It's one thing if you never moved away and can easily show up.  It's another thing if you moved your family during the pandemic and after you moved back to accommodate this request, they fire you anyway. 

If they fire you for this, they were going to fire you after you moved back anyway, so I'd just tell them to fire me if they want, they'll still end up with a lawsuit anyway."
2023-12-02,"It‚Äôs real and it is 100 percent intentional.  
I‚Äôm going to throw my cube in the garbage and get a generic Android TV box I can hack..Same thing happened to me too but fortunately you can technically disable it in settings (for now at least). The ads go full-screen when inactive but it doesn't autoplay video anymore and are static images..Can confirm, mine has done this over the last few weeks. Super annoying.

Although I've been told by a few employees from Amazon in Seattle that they believe this is a programming error with the cursor default position and that it wasn't intentional design. Only time will tell. Wouldn't be the first time they've missed something like this on a rushed update, but still assholish for letting it go to production..The update also basically bricked my stick. It still *technically* works but it went from being fine to now taking almost 3 minutes from the time I turn on the TV to when the ad loads, then it freezes on the ad, then it freezes whenever I try to open an app. In total it takes like 10 minutes to get to content..Well I‚Äôm never updating the one I have. I only have it bc I don‚Äôt want to let my plasma go.I immediately turn off its wifi connection and blacklisted it as soon as it started doing that..Every night when I'm falling asleep and I say ""Computer, turn off the TV"" now it plays a fucking loud ad instead and wakes the whole house up! What the fuck, Amazon!

Edit: on the phone with customer service now. I explained that a few days ago loud ads started playing upon starting my Fire TV. To troubleshoot this problem first they asked me to power cycle the device. I didn't want to argue so I humored them and did it. Still ads.Next step they asked me to turn off ""interest based ads"". Surprisingly that didn't remove ads all together lol. So now they told me they are researching the solution because they only had these two ideas that they were told these would get rid of the ads (???).So it's been 30 mins, I'm curious what they come up with. I'll report back once I have an actual solution.

Edit 2: the customer service representative got back to me and said that to ""\[their\] surprise this is also happening on \[their\] device in the office"". And that upon further research this is indeed part of the latest patch and is rolled out to all Amazon devices, and there is no going back. Now I asked for a refund on my devices as I don't accept advertisements in my home. They are all 3-5 years old so I'm pretty sure I'm SOL, but it sounds like this is the end of the Alexa ecosystem in my home.

Edit 3: Just finished the call, of course no refunds after these years. Their last suggestion was to turn off video and audio auto play in the settings, which they confirmed this patch automatically turned on. Turning this off just switches the videos out for full screen static ads. They forwarded the negative feedback and recommended more people call and complain about this change as the representative themselves was upset about this lol..Arrr me hearties. I hear the sea calling me back..This is the bad place.I‚Äôd always been annoyed by how they always pushed Alexa on the photos screensaver but switched to an Apple TV after they started playing ads. I‚Äôd drop Prime too if it weren‚Äôt for the Whole Foods benefits, they‚Äôre always pushing you to lump or delay deliveries‚Ä¶ which is good for the environment I guess but sort of negates the original value of Amazon Prime."

Since about 9:45 this morning, all Alexa devices were reporting that they were ""offline"" including echos and firesticks. Everything seems to be firing back up as we speak. Downdetector caught and reported the outage. At it's peak, it appeared to affect almost all of Florida, the SF bay area in Cali and the New York / Boston area on the eastern seaboard..Yeah it didn't drop out here in Washington state..I'm aware, but Downdetector reported outages at about the same time on both AWS and Alexa. I therefore assumed they were related - but I might have jumped the gun there.

In the meantime, I also see that Xfinity reported issues at about the same time. I didn't see any dropoff in Xfinity at my location. But they could have had something to do with the outage."
2023-06-14,"Amazon flexing too big to fail, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre more than you know‚Äù. Many other apps were affected..This happens quite often all things considered. Whenever there‚Äôs a known AWS outage, go to a site like Down Detector. It‚Äôs a site where users can report when certain web services are down. There‚Äôs a little stock market-like graph tied to each service that gives an idea of the recency and frequency that the site was reported to be down.

When AWS is down, it‚Äôs naturally at the top of the list. But‚Ä¶scroll through the entire list. You‚Äôll see that the services for an endless number of popular sites are also down. You‚Äôll also see that the little graphs indicating outage reports will be nearly identical to AWS‚Äô graph.

Half the global internet seemingly runs on AWS servers..‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry sir, the ice cream ordering machine is broken‚Äù.I figured it out when I saw the news of the outage.

>In addition to refusing blame, Amazon unsuccessfully argued that none of those harms could be considered physical injury. To the contrary, Chambers wrote that ""if proven,"" the plaintiff's physical harms are considered ""severe"" because ""emotional trauma inflicted during a child‚Äôs 'tender years' has an 'indelible effect' from which 'they may never recover.'""

Though unsurprising that Amazon tried to make these arguments, it‚Äôs hard to take them seriously given how these items (and others) are presented on the platform. Perhaps Amazon should pay more attention to the quality of the vendors and their products on the site..I'm all for tech companies having to do more due diligence for what they push out.

In what world is bathroom surveillance a legitimate use case?.Does eBay have to deal with this type of stuff?.[deleted].Amazon is in trouble for letting it be marketed to catch private moments in the bathroom. If it was just a ""hidden camera"", then they'd likely be off the hook.

People are going to use cameras for good and bad uses. Some people suck.

There are legitimate uses for hidden cameras (nanny cam or catching domestic abuse) so I don't think it's wise to just ban all hidden cameras because somebody might do something f'd up with them. In the same breath, we sometimes have to succumb to the lowest denominator and a few bad apples can ruin it for everyone else..‚ÄúA loss for Amazon could put the online retailer on the hook for punitive damages.‚Äù

2023-06-29,"Lots of negative product reviews on Amazon are really complaints about a seller. Amazon could improve the customer experience and address the complaints in this lawsuit by simply shutting down third-party sellers altogether. 

Go back to the old way of Amazon's website being where you bought from Amazon only..That will drag out in court for years, resulting in a fine that we lil people would consider catastrophic, but is a mere penance to Amazon. Just like all the rest of em.....>In June 2021,  Amazon petitioned the FTC to have Khan recuse herself from antitrust investigations into the company because of her previous public statements criticizing Amazon and later accused Khan's FTC of ""harassing"" its top executives. The Meta-owned Facebook also sought Khan's recusal. She has rejected such requests despite a recommendation from an FTC ethics official to recuse herself from adjudicating the Meta case.

So if you've ever said a monopoly should be broken up in the past, you should recuse yourself from trying to break it up when you have the power to do so.  Makes sense üôÑ.It might be a major lawsuit, bust rest assured Amazon investors, the fine will be minor..Theirs really a lot of negative products review but it's because of the seller fault..Can't wait to see how this one unfolds.

How‚Äôs it fair to leverage their billions in revenue from their cloud services to prop up their lost leader in their marketplace.

Capitalism is about survival of the companies that generates the most value to people. This practise is just creating a zombie business that kills off other competitors and innovations, harming consumers in the long run.

They brought audiobook a few years back and made it inaccessible for more behind a paywall. And they‚Äôre not add much value to users. Only to turn a good thing into a profit machine. And that machine isn‚Äôt even doing well at all..

2023-08-31,"I don't think anyone was surprised they spent more to avoid SpaceX, and that SpaceX would have happily launched those missions for a lot less cost than they're paying blue origin and ULA. This could get interesting. Shareholders are pointing out this massive expenditure was made NOT in the best fiscal responsbility that is *required*

From the filling 

> Inexplicably, the most famous, reliable and obvious launch provider inthe world‚ÄîSpaceX‚Äîwas not among the four companies presented to the AuditCommittee. SpaceX‚Äîfounded, owned, and managed by Bezos‚Äô longtime rival,ElonMusk‚Äîhas by far the most proven rocket launch track record in history, having now completed some 235 successful launches of its Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX is also known to be one of the most cost-effective launch providers, due to its ability to re-use rocket boosters and carry large payloads on each launch.

> Bezos was intimately familiar with SpaceX and Musk‚Äôs success, as BlueOrigin has repeatedly lost out to SpaceX in competing for lucrative government launch contracts. Each time, Musk has publicly taunted Bezos‚Äô loss on Twitter; and each time, Bezos has filed legal protests and challenges seeking to overturn the government‚Äôs decisions to choose SpaceX over BlueOrigin. In one notable instance, Blue Origin appealed the United Stat es government‚Äôs choice to award a multi- billion-dollar lunar contract to SpaceX, even though the government explained that it chose SpaceX because Blue Origin‚Äôs bid was nearly double SpaceX‚Äôs offered cost. In the face of SpaceX‚Äôs proven reliability and cost advantages, Bezos-led Amazon‚Äôs decision to not even consider  SpaceX as a launch provider illustrates the glaring conflict of interest Bezos‚Äô affiliation with both Amazon and Blue Origin presented, and the substantial impact these conflicts had on the Board‚Äôs ability to protect the best interests of the Company and its stockholders in negotiating the contracts..My understanding is these shareholders lawsuits usually don't get far. Executives can make some statement that they thought they were playing 5D chess in a move to further the goals of their corporate charter (which may not prioritize maximizing profit), and a Judge will usually accept that.

It'd be pretty easy to argue ""we thought SpaceX would go bankrupt due to developing Starlink and Starship, as their executives warned multiple times was possible since every prior satcom company had gone bankrupt."" Then provide Tweets backing that up..I've heard the claim that Amazon didn't go with SpaceX because they want to do more mass per launch than F9 can accommodate.

However, Falcon 9 has a higher capacity to LEO than both Ariane 6 and Atlas V.

It'll also be interesting to see what the potential remedies are. Even if there aren't contract provisions that consider Amazon pulling out (I'm sure there are), promissory estoppel / detrimental reliance would probably allow Blue Origin, ULA, and ArianeSpace to claw back a lot of the contract value based on the investments in infrastructure that they've made to support the flight rate desired by Amazon.

With that in play, it seems likely to me that the lawsuit would favor monetary damages rather than specific performance (i.e. re-bidding the contracts with SpaceX in the mix)..With all that I am sure SpaceX would fly those sats if they had asked. But I am not so sure SpaceX is very unhappy about not getting those launches. :).I always figured a big enough stockholder would see kuiper as a means to move funds to Jeff's other company..Here you see SpaceX' wisdom in _Not_ splitting Starlink off into a separate company.

If Bezos' plans had worked out, Kuiper would have been the flagship customer for New Glenn, and they also would have made back a big chunk of the puchase prices of Vulcan launches, which also use BE4 engines, thus helping BO get a higher production rate and helping BO improve the engines faster.

Unfortunately, as Branson and Bigelow have discovered before him, it is not enough to be a great administrator. To make the right decisions fast, you also have to be a brilliant engineer..> the combined contracts were ‚Äúthe second-largest capital expenditure in Amazon‚Äôs 25+ year history‚Äù after its $13.7 billion acquisition of grocer Whole Foods. Amazon‚Äôs second largest acquisition, of studio MGM in 2021, was valued at $8.5 billion.

Oof.Hay look on the bright side - Amazons satellites are going to be ready much sooner and cheaper going with Blue Origin aren‚Äôt they ? /s

(Hint: Blue Origin are yet to get anything into space..).  
(SpaceX: Are the world leaders).As a small shareholder of Amazon I fully agree that the Amazon board are exceeding their license. It is certainly not in our interests to saddle Amazon with launch costs in excess of 150 million USD per launch, compared to around 69 million USD for Falcon 9 launches. Essentially that means that we are funneling around 80 million USD for EVERY LAUNCH in the pockets of Jeff Besos..A Kuiper spokesperson has said that the F9 fairing was not large enough to support the required number of satellites per launch.  It only needs to be stated in court that there was a valid technical reason to not use SpaceX for the lawsuit to be dismissed.  

Naturally it was a limitation that could have been worked around at the design stage but it likely cannot be changed now."

![gif](giphy|87B3pCSy4t50DDm4pp).Would be kinda disappointing if this got canceled. Sony was finally trying to make projects with actual hero characters instead of villains like Venom, Morbius, Kraven etc. Their first tv show, had some good creatives behind it. Was actually looking forward to giving Silk a chance..I am increasingly convinced that Sony's Spider Man universe will end next year with Venom 3. With the rumors that Spider Man 4 will have connections with this universe, I think they will bring forward the merger of both before Secret Wars. I believe that Sony, starting with Spider Man 4, will leave Marvel the creative freedom of the character in film and TV, obviously they will take a percentage of those products, and Sony will only be in charge of the animated and video game part of the character that is where they have worked the most..I hope they can get this resolved. I was looking forward to seeing what Amazon could do with Silk and Spider-Man Noir.[deleted].Not surprised.So let me get this straight. Silk: Spider Society is a live action show about Silk. Who will also be making her debut in the upcoming animated Spider-Women movie set in the Into the Spider-Verse continuity. 

However live action Silk will not be the same Silk in the animated film despite the show having the subtitle ‚ÄúSpider Society‚Äù and the show is being produced by Lord and Miller who are making the Spider-Verse films. And instead is set in the SSU (Venom, Morbius, Kraven, etc) which is a universe that has already crossed into the animated Spider-Man films. Also both projects may be released roughly around the same time.(like within a year or two of each other)

Sony continues to amaze me.I'm so clueless about the SSU lmao
At first I was thinking about Sinister Six vs Tom Holland, but with Madame Web and Silk on their way, I'm not sure. I would be ok if they left Holland in the MCU and establish a new main Spider-person in the SSU.
The thing is that SSU is now part of the Multiverse discussion; so they have to conclude the crossover event before Secret Wars(?). Actually I don't want Spider-Man 4 to be another multiversal film."

2023-08-20,"Amazon built a data center empire in northern Virginia. Exclusive filings reveal it's using as much energy as a major city.

ÔøºAmazon's second headquarters undergoing construction in Arlington, Va., in 2021.

Amazon is in the midst of $87 billion of data center development in Virginia.

The company's data centers in the state can consume about half the power of New York City.

It's the largest player in a fast-growing industry that could stress grids and speed the climate crisis.¬†

Just a few miles from the $5 billion second headquarters that Amazon is raising outside of Washington DC, the tech giant is in the midst of a far larger, and less conspicuous, building boom.¬†

The company is in the process of developing $87 billion worth of data centers, a push that has already made it the biggest player in the world's largest data center market in northern Virginia. The featureless, warehouse-like structures are easy to miss on the sides of highways or tucked unassumingly amid suburban neighborhoods.¬†

Data centers, including Amazon's, play an increasingly central, but unseen role in modern life, housing the digital infrastructure that powers critical functions such as e-commerce, autonomous vehicles, video streaming, and, now, artificial intelligence.¬†

There is a flipside, however, to their now ubiquitous presence in places like northern Virginia. The facilities consume quantities of power so vast that they have begun to tax entire energy grids and could exacerbate the climate crisis.¬†

Amazon does not disclose how many data centers it occupies, where they are located, or how much electricity they consume. The company's data facilities are tied to its large cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which offers software, storage, and other services to legions of customers.¬†¬†

Based on a review of permits that Insider obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, Amazon operates, or is in the process of building or planning, 102 data centers in northern Virginia. Together, the facilities, when they are all up and running, will have emergency generators capable of producing more than 4.6 gigawatts of power. That's almost enough backup electrical capacity to¬†light up all of New York City¬†on an average day.¬†

In the data center industry, the installation of backup power is standard practice to guard against electrical interruptions and almost always exceeds the amount of electricity a facility actually consumes. Data centers generally use at least 60% of the power that a facility's backup generator are capable of producing to leave room for redundnancy, according to Shaolei Ren, an electrical and computer engineering professor at UC Riverside who researches power use in data centers.¬†

That would suggest that the power footprint for Amazon's northern Virginia data center portfolio will amount to at least 2.7 gigawatts ‚Äì 35% more than the¬†entire power grid¬†of the company's hometown city of Seattle.

David Ward, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment on Insider's analysis of the company's energy footprint in northern Virginia other than to say: ""Your estimate is inaccurate.""¬†

""All of a sudden, really for the first time in a generation, we're starting to see load growth become a major concern,"" said Abraham Silverman, a managing director at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. ""Data centers are coming in and driving hundreds and thousands of megawatts of new load.""

Many of Amazon's data centers listed in the permits have been built recently and some may still be under construction. A small handful appear not to have yet broken ground, meaning it could take years for the facilities to ramp up their operations to the point where they are consuming power at close to capacity, experts say.¬†¬†

Data center developers and users often build spaces that are larger than they initially need, ""with the expectation that they're going to ramp to it over 10 years or so,"" said Sean Brady, a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield who works within its global data-center advisory group.

There is other evidence that Amazon is not yet operating its portfolio at full throttle. Dominion Energy , the local utility in Virginia, disclosed that data centers there drew¬†2.8 gigawatts of electricity in 2022. The company doesn't break out individual consumer demand, but Amazon likely was responsible only for a portion of that.¬†

Why Virginia will need a power grid the size of France's

Power providers, however, are already preparing for the daunting challenge of meeting the data center industry's expanding needs. Their solutions could have major societal consequences.¬†¬†

PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission operator whose territory includes Virginia, forecast that the state may have to double the size of its grid in the next 15 years ‚Äî growth that would put its electrical capacity on par with all of France. The growth will cost billions of dollars and could leave rate payers across the state with the tab.¬†

ÔøºGov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia.

To meet such an ambitious expansion, Dominion Energy¬†recently proposed¬†putting off the retirement of fossil-fuel-burning infrastructure,¬†building new gas-fired power plants, and has made public comments supporting the Virginia governor's proposal to exit the¬†Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, an effort with 11 neighboring states to limit carbon emissions from power plants.

Virginia's Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin,¬†championed the plan, which will require approval from the State Corporation Commission, Virginia's public-utilities regulator.¬†¬†

As data centers have¬†expanded throughout the country¬†and the¬†power-hungry demands of artificial-intelligence software¬†begin to be felt, energy experts have said that the efforts to cut carbon across more grids could be challenged.¬†

Terry Boston, an energy executive who retired as the president and CEO of PJM in 2015, said that renewable energy often doesn't match the prodigious, around-the-clock power needs of data centers.

""You cannot run a data center based on the variability of solar and wind,"" Boston said. ""There's a lot being studied, but studies don't keep the lights on."".I dread to think how much power would be used if all computers were still on-prem instead of hosted..If only there was a way to capture and harness the suns energy for use at a later point in time. Some type of megapack per se.And that's just one data center...So‚Ä¶what‚Äôs the alternative?? I guess maybe spreading out the servers so they don‚Äôt hit one power grid exclusively?"

2023-12-01,"From the release:

\>We are preparing to start satellite manufacturing ahead of a full-scale deployment beginning in the first half of 2024, and we expect to have enough satellites deployed to begin early customer pilots in the second half of 2024.

\>Project Kuiper has contracted three Falcon 9 launches, and these missions are targeted to lift off beginning in mid-2025.

Two possible takeaways:

Realist- Since the SpaceX launches aren't contracted to happen until deployment is well underway, and its only 3 paltry launches, this isn't a big deal for anyone. It might however appease shareholders and their little lawsuit.

Pessimist - the actual launch dates are going to slip, and the 3 other launchers (Vulcan, Ariane 6, New Glenn) are very far behind their anticipated debut and they can't possibly ramp up fast enough to deploy what Kuiper is saying they will in 2024. Therefore these F9 launches are not only critical to speed up the deployment, but are also the start of a shift to move contracted launches from the other providers.

Time will tell here, as a launch failure or more delays of any of the providers above could drastically change the plan..Why so far down the road? Surely there are sooner available launches on the F9..I think it's known as risk reduction. Launch vehicles from ULA and BO aren't ready, but Amazon satellites are nearly ready.

In addition, Jeff B no longer controls Amazon. Even if he does, he cannot award a contract from a publicly traded company to his own private company because he wants to. It has to make business sense and with the board's approval..Kuiper was never developed with Blue Origin in mind so I doubt Bezos really cares.

Sounds like you did everything right. Not everyone can say they work for the White House. An inspiration to us starting. And yet the perfect storm after storm arrived.

How come you never thought of owning a building to house your business, maybe 5 years in? Too big of a space to afford?.This is one of the most well explained, heart warming and wrecking post that I have ever read.

You made me emotional.

I'm sure you have a safe net to rely on and that you will do good in life.

Take time to process.

Take a few months off and think about life and see if there are also other sectors that interest you.

The world is very different from 2005, the year you probably started. Look around and I'm sure you will find plenty of things to do.

Take care.I‚Äôd start over from scratch tbh"

2023-11-11,"The school admin person is forever on Santa's Nice List..Also, NORAD (?) Has a Santa Tracker in December sometime that ""tracks where Santa is via satellite"" that kids can watch before bed. 

At least......okay, I hope they still do. I guess it was a few years ago now; but my little siblings *loved* it. They'd get into bed practically vibrating with excitement all ""I saw it, Santa's on his way heeeeeeere!"".It astounds me every time I read a post like this that people like MIL exist. How does it get to this point?.Extraordinarily lucky that MIL called ahead to the school being weird. If she'd just shown up and just picked her up, this would be a very different story..There's a special place in hell for people who harm children for the sake of their own ego.

Imagine just flippantly telling a 4 y/o kid there's no Santa, apropos of nothing, just to make a point to another adult. It's so spiteful and cruel. Her other actions are just variations on the same: harming the child, either directly or indirectly, in order to undermine the parents and vainly attempt to establish superiority.

2023-09-12,"You need a lawyer immediately, before saying the word divorce. Once you have a lawyer to help you, then you serve the divorce papers, that way any action he takes in retaliation will be documented. That is your only option. Also, leave and stay with trusted family or friends.

Edit: Obviously OP is being financially abused. She already engaged with other commenters about it, that's why I didn't feel the need to add it on my original comment. There were less than 50 comments when I added mine, and now there's over 700. She knows she is in a bad marriage and wants to leave, but doesn't think she can. I just hope now after seeing all these comments she will finally get the strength to start the next part..See an attorney immediately. Never mention divorce again and quietly plan your escape..>I know our marriage isn't healthy and we have discussed divorcing recently. When we discuss divorce, he gets angry, he cuts off the direct deposits, shuts my phone off, takes the car, and more until I tell him sorry and that I won't divorce him.

Based on what I see in your comment history, you are located in the US, so this advice is based on you being in the US. Set up a consultation with a divorce attorney in your area and let them know your situation. Most attorneys will give you a consultation for free. If you decide to pursue a divorce, an attorney can file a motion asking the court to force your husband to either pay your bills himself or give you money directly while the divorce is pending. It is called pendente lite support. (Pendente lite means ""pending the litigation"" in Latin.) 

If you're worried about coming up with the funds to hire the attorney, then they can guide you with that as well. In addition to the pendente lite support, an attorney can also file a motion asking the court to give you an advance on equitable distribution. For example, if your husband has $20,000 in his checking account, the court could make him give half of that to you now rather waiting until the divorce is finalized. Then when it is time to finalize the divorce that $10,000 that you received up front would be taken out of the amount of equitable distribution you are owed. Alternatively there are organizations that will cover the cost of legal fees or provide free legal services to women in vulnerable positions such as yourself. An  attorney may know of organizations in your area, and be able to set you up with them.

>He doesn't give me access to any of the online banking and all but one bank account is solely in his name.

Also, don't let the fact that the bank accounts are in his name discourage you from getting a consultation with an attorney. If the money in those accounts was acquired during the course of your marriage from his paycheck, then you are entitled to your share of those funds. It doesn't matter if the account is only in his name. His paycheck is considered martial income, so his checking account would be considered a marital account even though it is only in his name. Same thing if you own a house, and it is only in his name. Just because it is only listed in his name doesn't mean that he won't have to buy you out of it. If the house was purchased during the course of your marriage with his paycheck, then it is a marital asset. The only way you wouldn't get a cut of the house is if the house was a gift to your husband or he purchased it with funds he earned prior to marrying you. I hope this helps. Good luck!.[removed].So your husband gets in house maid, caretaker or his kids, sex vending machine that does not ask for anything and barely survives on no income. He spends his money how he wishes, what do you get out of this? Now he will start taking your income cause he‚Äôs used to this gravy train. Where are your benefits of this marriage?"

2023-07-01,"Medication and therapy. Kratom helps me particularly..Honestly certs have been great for my lack of focus. After I failed out of college ...three times... I thought I was doomed.

But being able to study for 5 min here, 10 min there, toss a video on while doing chores. Having a bad week ? Take it off. Removing the timeline pressure of traditional school and a heavier focus on results made certs a dream.

Labs were also the big thing for me, hands on puzzles. By being more lab focused rather than book focused I made huge leaps. 

Even right bow I am alternating between 20-30 min of video games then 5 min of videos. Back and forward. Works well for me. 

Earned over 40 certs in my career and counting with this method. 

Anyhow, good luck in your journey!.So insert obligatory ""See your doctor"" answer here.

That being said, I struggle with ADHD, Anxiety, and Manic Depression. I have a similar issue. I have a desire, but this ""childlike wonder"" some of the people on here recommend having is just not something I can do. It's either I enjoy it, or I absolutely hate it. That's where depression becomes a tool. The nihilistic opportunist. You need to carve out discipline, not just motivation. This is 100x harder for people with ADHD. You will need to think hard about what you want (and especially what you DON'T want). For me, my Help Desk role is paycheck to paycheck living. I managed to escape being bailed out biweekly by my parents, finally. But it's not enough. I don't own a home, my car is a piece of shit, and I can't afford my hobbies or vacations. I pinch pennies and any form of dopamine sets me back financially. 

As far as I'm concerned, I'm living in purgatory. So what can I do? I can lie down and die or I can get myself out. Right now it's not easy but all I can do is follow the money. That being said, don't forget to have fun on the way. Once you have identified a path, don't think about it too much. You will have doubts, fears, and you will be showered with worthless opinions. Figure out what skills you need and just go for it. It's a lot like going to the gym. The first 3 months are just showing up, even if you don't break a sweat. Although for us with ADHD habits are hard to form, so we will rely on muscle memory here. Also, you will need a plan. One with both macro goals and micro goals. 

To start off, 5-10 minutes a day reading or learning about a skill or skills you want to develop. Make sure to set aside time for this. Avoid distractions. Try not to study in the same place as you play. Of course this isn't possible for me right now and may not work for you. I often will ""wake up"" and find myself scrolling through Facebook or I might spend 25 minutes picking out the perfect Lo-Fi mix to study with. That's just part of having ADHD. You will need to conquer this one sentence at a time. One paragraph, on page, one chapter, one video, etc at a time. 

Also, don't be afraid to CREATE your studies. I found that making flashcards helps me tremendously. You might find success in making videos or voice recordings of yourself explaining certain things.  It's far easier to focus on a task than to listen to someone drone on about some technology we used 14 years ago. Find what works best for you. Also, you WILL burn out. I guarantee it. A dozen times. Since I started going for my Bachelor's degree on top of full-time work, my panic attacks have come back. My IBS got worse and I'm miserable. Still, I don't get a choice. My doctors won't listen and I doubt they care, anyway. 

And that's the gist of it. We can let our mental health hold us back or we can learn to live with it. I would recommend therapy. I found some respite in Buddhism (albeit I am a terrible Buddhist... Being an existentialist and all.) Alan Watts is also a great listen. Listening to him speak you wouldn't even guess most of it was recorded in the 1940's-1960's. Some people discard him as a drunkard but I think it is imperative to his character.

Anyway, I think ultimately we need to work towards maximizing the potential we were given. We have to understand our weaknesses and learn to correct them or compensate for them. I don't believe in ""success"" or ""happiness"" in the traditional sense, but it's important to try anyway. There's nothing to lose and everything to gain. Good luck..I just passed my CISSP and take vendor certs regularly. I have ADHD that I don't medicate and multiple TBIs.

You can do it. Just need to assess your learning strengths and capitalize on them. Everyone learns differently..I believe I can relate to this post and OP more than anyone as I have  BP 1, depression and ADHD, diagnosed in 2012.  I'm also an IT Engineer (Infrastructure). I have A+, Network+, Security+, Azure AA, MCSA, MCSE, MCITP, ITILv3, Venafi and a couple other vendor-specific certs. 

I can say without my meds, I can't read beyond page 5 of any book. Also, I learn best from watching training videos from several different sources. I view things like this:  if I were to watch an awesome movie, and you tested me on it, I'd pass with flying colors. After all, it was an amazing movie. Now if it was a boring movie that I have no interest in , I'd probably fail a quiz on it.  

My point is, by using a variety of training videos to learn a particular topic/subject, one of them will be more interesting and you're going to retain more from it."

""I need more people to help with CPTs."" ""We don't have anyone to spare. Figure it out."" (I'm L1, not even a PG let alone a PA). 20-25 minutes later VTO 23 people, 17 people, 19 people. When my PA running the board would put me somewhere else, my OPs would come within 5 minutes and say, ""you're needed in Tans. It's blowing up."" I escalated to HR and upper management but no one cared. Nothing was done. After 3 months I transfered to pack. Best move I ever made. I'm busy running 9 slam lines/18 printers, but if I ask for help, it's there, and my anxiety is again at bay!! But yeah, ""Amazon cares"" -NOTTT!!!!... lmsfaoooooo.Yeah"
2023-12-16,"Counseling is no longer reportable. Only diagnoses of specific, serious mental illnesses like psychosis are, or hospitalizations.

Be wary when getting evaluated for ADHD, a lot of times they jump straight to depression or worse, borderline personality disorder. Especially when you bring up daydreaming (they jump to dissociative issues) or motivation issues. Make sure you understand the terminology you (and the physician) are using and it'll save you a lot of headache.

If you're struggling a lot with motivation, I recommend body doubling. ADHD is an issue where the brain seeks the most immediately interesting thing going on to stimulate itself. If it is something you have, the best way to manage is to take away anything that can possibly be more interesting to you when you need to get something done.

2023-07-09,"You will never make everyone happy. Sometimes, maybe even most of the time, you won‚Äôt make anyone happy. The expectation is for you to do more with less. You will NEVER be able to accomplish everything you‚Äôre asked to do.

I did not work OPS at a delivery station, but I worked FC OPS. My theory was if I take care of my associates, they‚Äôll take care of me.

2023-07-31,"I got into META at 101 last year. Imagine I sold at a 30% profit. Don't sell a winner. Holding AMZN and META both..Whenever any of my investments that have risen faster than expected I go one of two routes:

1. Let it ride!
2. Sell  my principle investment and let your profits ride!

The thing is, if you do leave a position entirely you should do so because you have a burning desire to invest in a new position or plan to take a breather in cash.  Otherwise why sell a winner?.If you are holding longterm, why would you sell after it goes up 30%? Do you think Amazon will never go higher? The chances you are able to time tops and bottoms perfect are very slim..Something to think about...Amazon has invested something like 40 billion in the last 4 years in their company.  Why leave before they've even experienced a return on all that capital investment?.If it were me, personally, take back the inital investment and let the rest ride."
2023-06-24,"I've been holding for 9 years at <$16/share, 26% annualized return. I'm not selling any time soon..Amazon appears to be fairly valued right now, so there would need to be some major catalyst to juice the stock to $200 in two years. That seems unlikely. If anything, I see more headwinds at this point with high interest rates dampening consumer spending and a possible economic slowdown. Also, the FTC enforcement action doesn‚Äôt help. I like AMZN as a long-term buy and hold but I‚Äôd look elsewhere for aggressive growth. That‚Äôs my view anyway..Hold.

Just hold it.I think you're overthinking it. Whatever gains you make on an 82 share/$10k investment is not going to move the needle for a long time. I know it's fun to dream about, but Amazon could double and you still only have \~$20k. Put your mental energy on saving and investing more to grow your pie faster. Furthermore, everyone should have some exposure to Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc. I personally have no thesis on which big companies to own and where they're headed so instead I own a S&P500 index fund for my long-term investments so I don't have to worry about it.  I never would have guessed that NVDA would have the run that it did this year. Fortunately, I didn't miss out on it..[deleted]"
2023-11-16,"Nobody knows. The whole point of investing in an ETF for the SP500 is to diversify. So you will get stocks that overperform and that underperform. Since in the long term, you don't know which stock will do what, you take them all. This year these tech companies overperformed. In other years they have or might not.

If you are convinced they will overperform, then of course buy them. Personally, since they already make up a large amount of the SP500 in an ETF, I am happy to just keep it at that..[deleted].Much of the m7 run is behind us... That's how they acquired the name.  

(The next run will be by the ?7... The mystery 7, mystery because nobody can today identify them... wait a year and you'll have missed that, too)

Pick 1, 3  or all..  and divide 50% between S&P and your picks.   Has worked for me... S&P isn't building wealth, it's preserving it..[deleted].Yes, if you pick the top 7 performers in the stock market for the past several years, and you backtest them for the past several years, it will show that they are top performers.

Will that mean that they will continue to be top performers? Impossible to say. In fact, it's just as likely that the rest of the market will catch up and the M7 will lag to even things out. The reality is that you, and anybody else, has no idea.

Ultimately, I will always choose diversification, especially if you have a wider time frame."

2023-11-04,"AMZN showed expanded profitability and AWS should pick up in a better economy. I don‚Äôt see any compelling seasons to sell. As for the antitrust issue, typically nothing comes of those. GOOGL makes the majority of its revenue on advertising. Ad-spend is already picking back up and should I get better over time. GOOG also has their LLM in the works and that could be a boon for the company once they iron out the kinks. If AWS starts taking more market share for GOOG, that is a concern. At the same time, there may be room for both to thrive..Buying more of both. Probably won‚Äôt think of selling for years..Where would you put the money is the better question not being asked

Few companies have better growth strategies than either.I am holding onto Goog . I think it was way oversold. I'm  waiting for the release  of Gemini and hopefully it will be amazing . If it goes to the 140s again I may consider selling.I bought Alphabet on the dip.

Everyone's obsessed with cloud, but cloud just isn't that big to Alphabet. Its very big for Microsoft and is most (all?) of Amazon's profit.

And I'm going to add: for a lot of work there is no moat. Clouds that I know of: AWS, Azure, IBM, Oracle, Alibaba, Cloudflare. Competition is hotting up and margins are going to get tighter."

2023-07-24,"[removed].I like the idea of shorting Apple. Look for it to set a high sometime early this week before the FoMC and the run up before earnings. I also think spotify is due for a short. Also this is just straight speculation and Im not a advisor I just been watching the market everyday for the last two years.I'd suggest starting with how much you want to hedge the position.  For example, if you're long 4900 shares of GOOG, how much exposure do you want to reduce? are you trying to get to talk the long exposure? (read as delta...) or 1/3? For positions like this, think of limiting your risk.  But remember that you can't have your cake and eat it too. Meaning you can't hedge but still gain from a large pop on earnings, AND not spend a bunch on your hedge.    


Once you decide how much you want to reduce your deltas, look at what options allow you to do that.  Via selling calls out of the money, or selling spreads, or buying puts/ put spreads.  Your broker should be able to help you with this..It‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶and kind of true.  Your response, unnecessary as my comment to your response.

You looking to hedge your position is weak.  Unless you are on a mission to make a certain amount of money, you hold.  Unless you are willing to sell / trim, the only thing you are doing is being greedy to make / not lose to a correction not pay taxes.

So.  Buy a strangle, near ATM and 20 cons each.
Enjoy the ER either way..You're looking for. ""protective collar"" which is selling a otm call to buy an otm put. This hedges your position to any movement for the duration of the option. However! A large jump and the short call will go itm and your shares can get called away (no loss though) 

You can also do a short synthetic, a short ATM call and a long ATM put. But these are more likely to be assigned ."

The whole Chinese market is severely undervalued, but the country risk makes it a speculative bet rather than a long term buy and hold.

Country risk. 

That risk of not knowing whether the USA will ban Chinese e-commerce retailers  like how Huawei was banned from Google store. The risk of having no access to chips.  Or like how Bytedance has to divest from Tik Tok by January. Or else.

Or else what? 

That is country risk. 

Same applies to PDD, Shein and / or Alibaba and a whole lot of Chinese companies.

(Disclosure: bought yumc sold yumc made 31% as a speculative bet).I own JD and BABA.

This Q income is pumped by recent stock movements that they own, its non-cash appreciation. Balance sheet is great. Cloud is growing. International is growing (still burning cash though).

BUT - they are constantly losing their market share in china online retail, what is their cash cow and core business. Cash from operations is also in constant decline due to fierce competition in China. They recently changed the way they charge their clients, next Q will show how it affects FCF.

Its is undervalued, but not super undervalued like it was in $60/70. There is also a ton of JVs/subsidiares on their BS that may finally be spun off. Its able to generate $10-20bn FCF/year what is quite amazing.

If you want some China/South East Asia exposion - JD and BABA look like top picks.

Aha, chinese commies made a U-turn recently and seem to be extremely shareholder/capital friendly. They encourage buybacks and even lend money to make BBs..I own both.

I was 30% down on Amazon, and now 50% up.

I was 50% down on Alibaba, and still 8% down today.

I believe in them, these companies are in top position to benefit to where the world is going..Unrelated question: what‚Äôs Michael Burry‚Äôs latest success. I know his big shot, but didn‚Äôt hear any great success lately.China retail is super competitive with everyone encroaching on each others territories. On my recent visit to China locals would tell me they would use TaoBao to buy clothes, JD for electronics and white goods (to avoid the fakes and better delivery), Douyin (TikTok) to even buy at restaurants now and PDD for cheap discounted basic household items, my fear is there is very little moat now amongst the players. JD has invested the most in vertical integration but the market is so cut throat competitive it‚Äôs not clear to me that‚Äôs going to be a successful long term play as it has been for Amazon in the west taking on the incumbent bricks and mortar retailers"
2024-03-03,"[removed].anything positive or negative with AWS will move the stock more than any retail amazon news.PUTs. I‚Äôm in!.I‚Äôm actually thinking of reducing my investment in Amazon. Wading through Chinese crap and counterfeits shouldn‚Äôt be something I have to deal with and it‚Äôs gotten soooo bad. Your account could simply have a few filters that you trigger at the account level so you never see the crap; no resellers, low returns, prime shipping only, and suddenly the experience would be good again. Until they take their customer experience seriously again, my interest as an investor is waning..This is a great dd, however, i disagree with the conclusion. 

Historically Amazon has spared no expense and reinvested all cashflow in growth.  This is why it maintains such a high pe ratio, people expect it to grow.  But the penny pinching you described has become prevalent.  Why is this a new focus for amazon? Because Jassy has no tricks left in the hat.  Amazon has no more s curve ideas.  So Jassy is racing the lower the P/E ratio because he knows that once the market realizes amazon is not much different from Walmart with a cloud business the valuation will change to match.  

Historically Amazon has massively benefited from first mover advantage and has only dominated in spaces where they started with a strong head start.  (Online retail, alexa, cloud). However they fail massively in spaces where they dont have a lead. (Fire phone, amazon wallet, and a thousand more).  But amazon just missed the boat big time on ai, this should have been the next s curve. Amazon was poised for it.  They have massive amounts of data, engineering talent, and money.  They just flopped.  Imo they have lost their spark, Jassy is not the right guy to lead the business and amazon is entering its balmer era.

I worked in corporate for 3+ years and anyone in corporate will tell you the same.  Many of them are just milking amazon for a paycheck while knowing the company has no direction, its an open secret in the company."

Sorry to burst your bubble but it‚Äôs never going away and there isn‚Äôt a single thing the company can do to ‚Äúscrew itself‚Äù the market loves cheap labor with high turnover and even if they deviate from that, Amazon will find a way to make more profit. They don‚Äôt just deliver packages. They have a whole web services department that hosts MAJOR servers for different companies. I was able to buy when it dropped to around $85 2 years ago and I‚Äôm up 130%. At this price point I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt buy, but anything in the 150-160 range is 100% a buy for me. Could also see what r/stocks has to say. 

TLDR: market doesn‚Äôt care about high turnover it actually like that model because usually means Cheaper labor which means more profit. I don‚Äôt see a downside to Amazon EVER..A corporation as psychopathic as Amazon will be just fine.I don't get paid enough to own stocks.

2024-07-17,"Friend of mine sent me a link this morning to a Sage Espresso machine, Prime Day deal has it at ‚Ç¨535 and ‚Ç¨750 is the price crossed off. 

3 retailers in Ireland selling it at ‚Ç¨500 - ‚Ç¨550 as it's full price. It's a total scam of an offer, as are most on Prime Day.Prime day is just a marketing ploy.The only deal you'll get is on something that you've been tracking the price of for awhile and then if it's actually lower during Prime Day. You'll know for sure then if you've actually made a saving..Are they calling it a sale?

I think they're making the distinction that there is ""their"" price and the RRP.

Prime Day is described as a deal event, not a sale.

It's still scummy but I'd say they're working within, or around, UK and Irish laws on sales by not claiming it as a sale.

You even use the term deal yourself in reference to it..I use the Keepa app (they have a website browser extension too), allows you to see historical prices and also allows you to add a tracker with custom price thresholds.

Do you a) cut prices so more people can buy your product/good/service? b) increase prices so whoever is buying offsets those who are not? c) keep price the same but offer less?

And we've just gotten b) and c) used for so long that we're at the limits. So now that a) is being embraced, it's just going to show more people just how long and how often b) and c) have been screwing them over by.

At the same time, we need competition again. There's fewer competitors with each passing year, and it's also affected how b) and c) have unfolded for so long and often. All it will take is someone who looks at a product or good or service, realize ""I can offer better for less"", invest into making it happen, and then they will get the people flocking to them. What must change after that is that we get it to where the so-called ""line"" doesn't need to go up by a crazy amount each year like clockwork.

I worked for a company that sold to Amazon, and the experience of having to deal with all of the counterfeit and grey market items in their marketplace dissuaded me from ever buying from any 3rd party seller there.

2024-12-31,"Of course he thinks they're great, they're basically indentured servitude contracts.

That's why these conservative politicians love illegal immigration too, btw. They talk as if they hate it, but what they really hate is easy LEGAL immigration. Because that doesn't give them the ability to exploit people. But if you make people even being in the country illegal, you can always threaten to call ICE if they don't take your workplace abuse or they make a fuss about your wage theft.

Conservative voters think people like Trump are racists like them who just don't want the brown people ""stealin' their jobs."" But in reality people like Trump just use racism to get elected and make sure to criminalize a whole population being in the country so they can be exploited. And, of course, the ways for legal immigration are attempted to be made super restrictive so those people can also be exploited with indentured servitude contracts.

But when these politicians or billionaires have to choose between racism and money, they will always choose money. Because the racism is just a tool to them..Didn't this dude make his entire platform about getting rid of immigrants? He wants to have them take MORE of our jobs? üòÇ.Cope and seethe.

2025-01-17,"I got scammed as well. Bought legit from amazon with sandisk as the seller. Amazon sent me a legit replacement. Pretty sure I had to run f3 to detect the fake. Sounds the same as the counterfeit 58GB card OP mentions. The packaging on the legit replacement actually looked more fake than the fake one. A ripped up looking plastic baggy was semi stapled inside the package of the packaging to hold the bigger sd card reader. But, sure enough, f3 passed that test and gave legitimate specs for the replacement!

Amazon is such a shithole for this kind of thing. I would have preferred to buy elsewhere I just happened to have an amazon gift card and nothing else to spend it on..Amazon has something called ""commingled inventory"" where Amazon pours the item of the same title into the same bin/inventory regardless whether they come from legit or suspect sources. This way the ""same"" product is in a larger bin rather than having several seperate bins/inventory but Amazon does not check the actual product or their sources.

 This can result in you buying from a legit company a legit product on their legit link but still get a fake. Amazon does not care because commingled inventory is faster and they care more about making a sale than something as insignificant as fraudulent advertising. It does not matter if you are using Prime or whatever. 

Amazon has decided that the shitty practices of chinese sites are the secret of even greater success than near-monopoly. 

You are better off buying directly from the manufacturer or from an IT store that does not do this bullshit..What software did you use to identify the usable amount?.Agree. I‚Äôve had a fake Sandisk Ultra card a couple of years ago, bought off the Amazon Sandisk store, dispatched and sold by Amazon. Amazon were good about it but I now never buy SD cards off Amazon. Bricks and mortar stores or the official Sandisk website instead, never had a fake from either..That's why the first thing I do with my new SD cards is run them through H2TestW. Might take a while, but gives me peace of mind and if it doesn't pass I send it right back."
2025-01-24,"Look at their EPS growth for PE and also their AWS numbers. Amazon isn‚Äôt that expensive considering how much money gets reinvested into the business.They still have a lot of product segments in their nascent stage, they're constantly entering new markets. I agree E-commerce's major growth is behind them, but they are dipping their toes in everything..Cause Amazon is not focused on increasing their profitability at the moment. They are heavily reinvesting into capex and continuing to focus primarily on revenue growth and operating cash flow growth..Amazon is a long way away from being oversaturated. Matter of fact they are just in the very early stages of ecommerce, cloud and advertising.  

Ecommerce: Amazon currently owns a 40% market share in ecommerce and gaining but ecommerce is only 15% of total retail in the United States. Who is going to be the biggest beneficiary when ecommerce grows to 35%-40% of US retail in the next several years. Based upon the above numbers Amazon currently owns 6% of retail in the US with 94% yet to go.
These numbers don‚Äôt account for international ecommerce which has almost an infinite amount of growth potential.

AWS: Amazon currently owns a 31% market share of cloud computing but cloud computing only represents ~ 12% of all enterprise IT. Who is going to benefit the most when penetration rates eclipse 70%-80% enterprise cloud adoption. These numbers will be staggering.

Advertising: Amazon currently has a $50+ billion run rate with 40% margins growing 20% per year. They are third in advertising market share behind Google and Meta with lots of room to run..Because it‚Äôs f*cking Amazon. No other company compares. Look at the services they offer. Their logistics. Juggernaut swallowing up everything as they go.¬†"

2025-01-21,"For clarity your RSUs should be taxed as income when they vest, and then the only cap gains tax you'd pay is on the difference in vest price vs. sale price when you sell (if someone knows more please correct me)..Would you take out 38k in loans to buy Amazon stock? There‚Äôs your answer..People will give you the mathematical correct answer but if being debt free helps free you mentally you cannot put a price on that..LTCG: If you sell later when you have low or no income, your tax rate can be as low as 0%.

You could split the difference - sell enough to pay the higher loan off (and pay the LTCG on that amount). The 4% loan is a pretty low rate, and this way you're only trimming the position by 25%.

That said, AMZN is overvalued right now for the first time in ten years (per Morningstar).

Will you be getting more such RSUs? That might enter your calculus as well..I wouldn‚Äôt pay off either of the student loans.  Up to $2,500 of interest is tax deductible, so your effective rate on the loans are likely pretty low.  Your combined effective rate is probably around 3.8% even without money from your employer.

Since the money from your employer exceeds the interest on the loan, they are literally paying you not to pay it off.

Edit:  Better advice.  Since your loans qualify for extended repayment‚Ä¶ extend them.  That will increase the payoff time by 15 years.  Then pay $416 per month on student loans ($208 from you and $208 from employer).  It will take about 9 years and 10 months to pay off your loans, but you will only pay $24,500 (before tax deduction of interest).  There is no scenario where your net payout is lower."

I agree it‚Äôs a conservative company but I wouldn‚Äôt add to it at these prices. Unless I‚Äôm missing something?.GOOG, AMD, BABA, EVO, ASML.> ASML

Looking at their guidance for 2025, their revenue growth is expected to be about 10-18%. It is not bad at all, but it is an expensive stock at 36 PE. 

About ASML. I understand the power of their moat and how unique their EUV product is. I also know that their products are also *very* reliable with word that some of them have lasted a decade. 

Given this, isn't there a low chance for recurring sales given the small number of customers they have? The major customers are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. Once they buy EUV machines for their foundries, they won't need to buy a lot more would they? 

Or am I thinking this very wrong for this type of industry? 

I understand roughly 25-35% of their revenue is ""recurring"" from service contracts. But that isn't the major source... 

Also, China being cut off would be a major cut to their growth since they were about half their revenue at one point. 

Is all of this just par for the course when investing in a very cyclical company?

I love Amazon. I wish I had bought some in the 2022 decline, but I did buy a bunch in the beginning of August when stocks declined at ~$160. If it falls again for some reason, I'll buy more. 

They are blasting on all cylinders. AWS is strong. Advertising is strong. 3rd party services is strong. All 3 are growing double digit revenue. 

Streaming is strong. Prime Video is 2nd biggest streamer in the world (competing with Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock...). They will soon have about 66 regular games stream on Prime (not all of them, sadly). This will improve Advertising. 

Project Kuiper is a long-term investment and quite exciting. I do wish/hope they use SpaceX to launch satellites because they will get there faster. But SpaceX competes with Blue Origin so...... doubt it. 

And their Health stuff looks interesting too.

I have owned for almost a decade now, and have  added my position last year. In December they released some amazing AI tools for Gemini 2.0, which really shows how close they are to ChatGPT. And they have announced plans for more releases in January too. the LLMs are all quite close to each other now (excluding OpenAI's O3 model which has not released yet). 

Amazingly, their Gemini is completely built on Google's TPUs. Which is great because these AI and LLMs are very expensive to run on compute. But Google's TPUs gives them an advantage in cost. So unlike OpenAI and Microsoft, Google is not paying for the Nvidia tax for a ~70% margin high premium product. Google has a cost advantage. 

Why does this matter even though the Big Tech have a lot of cash already? Well, Google is able to release their new AI tools like Gemini 2.0 Flash models at a *much* better price/performance compared to OpenAI. I think last I saw it was about 100x cheaper than OpenAI's O1 model for developers to use. That is a *huge* difference. 

I admit, I really underestimated Google in AI... I know they have invested in it for years, but that does not necessarily mean the results will follow. It appeared (to me) that they wanted to only rely on the Google Search moat and cashcow. Their Gemini 1.0 was quite lackluster, in my opinion. But with 2.0, wow. They really hit it out of the park! 

What else is in their AI? In December they released Deep Research which is really cool for researching whatever topics have your fancy. They released NotebookLM this year which is quite popular. They will soon release Google Veo2, which is for AI generated videos and is absolutely phenomenal, blowing Sora out of the water. Mark my words, ads we see on YouTube will soon be Auto-generated when you Click on the video by Veo2. Ads won't be custom made manually soon, they will be mostly (not 100%) AI generated based on your Google history. 

Also, they are soon releasing Project Astra, Project Mariner (AI Agents), Project Jules (for coding). 

And this doesn't even touch on Google Cloud which is growing very fast too. Since 2023, the Revenue is bigger than YouTube. The industry is big enough for the Big 3 Cloud providers globally. 

Plus, Search is still growing. It was 12% YoY growth in the last Quarter. And YouTube is growing ~12% too..UBER

2024-10-30,"Do you currently work there? You may be restricted from options on your company while employed (I know I am)..Just make sure you select a strike you are willing to sell at when assigned. So dont sell at strike $100 if you wanted $150 at a minimum (or whatever the current price is).I sell calls on AMZN stock every week.

Learn about delta.  Understand when you will roll / manage and why.  

With a book of strikes across several expiry dates you can make money, but research how you will react to various what-if scenarios BEFORE trading!.As soon as you do this, AMZN will rocket to $300 and start paying a dividend üòÇ in which case you‚Äôd limit your upside and lose the passive income you‚Äôd gain from dividends in search for covered call premiums (kidding but this would be my luck).sounds like you at least put thought into it.   
  
I agree with u/ConbiniMan's assessment as well - dont risk what you dont want to happen  
  
you mentioned 11%+ OTM, while that alone is a good range, maybe push it out more assuming you dont want to actually lose them and in case there's some Earnings-like catalyst.   
another idea would be to Wheel them"
2024-11-26,"Maybe it‚Äôs a lot simpler than all that overthinking. They spent 7 months with you, gave it a good go, in the end found you were simply not all that compatible or something soon wore thin. Maybe they tried to ignore it at first but eventually couldn‚Äôt anymore and ended it‚Ä¶and felt relieved. Maybe it didn‚Äôt mean as much to them as it did to you. It happens. No need for all this overthinking, drama and pathologising. And maybe they don‚Äôt get a kick out of the subsequent contacts. Maybe they just wanted it to stop and are once again simply relieved that it‚Äôs finally ended..[deleted].The only people that get it are the people with avoidant attachment style or people who weren‚Äôt into you in the first place.broke no contact after over 6 months and he‚Äôs still on that dumper‚Äôs high apparently.I can confirm this as a dumper. While it sounds like the end-all scientific truth, things can be hard and nuanced, we (dumpers) are also human beings capable of self-awareness. I am aware there is some truth to it, and if this truth helped you and others move on, it's fantastic.

The thing is, I was aware of the ""relief"" you talked about. Because it seemed for a moment like it's been a long time you haven't been true to yourself, authentic, and that you're taking the right decision for your well-being. And with my ex now (not really yet, weird, still on a breakup/pause) we're still chatting, and trying to get some time apart to figure what went wrong and decide later with more clarity, as she begged and asked for a ""pause"", and I accepted, because I love her, and if I'm honest, it would be easier for both of us, less dramatic, especially so that now she moved out of our home. Which was very hard when she was still here (for both of us: we had sex, many chats, and continued living as if nothing happened almost... delusional).

Deep down, it's almost like I wish she decides it's over anyways, that she heals, thinks and acts like you did, I wish she reads your posts, and asks me to go no contact. And even if she doesn't do it, if I endup not living to false hopes that a redo would be nice, that she'd change etc, finding the courage to cut contact, I know deep down and for sure, that I'll be devasted with the reality of not having her in my life completely and definitively and forever. I'm ready to bear the burden of this pain, and at the same time I'm terrified of the very moment I'll realize she's gone, forever, and that nothing could fix or change that.

We love each other, but I broke up because of many incompatibilites that made me miserable in the relationship. It's so hard. I love her so much, that there are moments I just wish she was the one dumping me, I'd have had to endure the humiliation, loss and abandonment pain and not her.

I just wanted to give a piece of nuance, I'm not invalidating your vision, it's even very accurate to the T."

2024-08-17,"How has your net income per month changed since hiring 10 employees? That is a massive scale up since your last post..I know nothing about the industry and am generally pretty financially conservative, but assuming $100k/month for 5 years seems optimistic. Your highest grossing months are at $200k? Things can change very quickly. You‚Äôre dependent on a single platform, porn laws, AI, change in competition etc. This industry is very young and celebrity income is fickle.¬†You now have 10 employees which I imagine could flip your cash flow into the negative very quickly.¬†


In any case, you‚Äôre already FI so it probably doesn‚Äôt matter if something changed. Congrats on all the success and thanks for sharing.¬†.Wow, extremely impressed with your situation. Best of luck!.Since you have spent 3 years on OF, how will you assess what your next endeavour will be? Will it be related to whatever your student loans funded, or from your OF experience?.Was it difficult making the jump from being a sole proprietorship to hiring employees? I‚Äôm at the point where my business is becoming too much for me to handle by myself, but hiring strangers feels daunting. Misplaced nerves?

2024-11-20,"Nov and May are the vest dates. That‚Äôs a very good point üëç.Good point about RSUs and the selling pressure in November. I get why that 3.5M share sell candle could trigger more selling. 

I‚Äôm a bit worried since I was planning to sell my shares (200) in February to put towards a house build. Hoping it doesn‚Äôt dip too much by then‚Ä¶.I have December 13th calls at 215, holding and fighting tooth and nail to recover losses. Hopefully it rebound this week or the next..

2024-08-17,"You have a team of 10 that manages your page/workload. Business idea - if you want to be a boss -  would be to start up a content management company to offer your services and manage other folks pages, using those 10 folks you have and grow with their knowledge and skill set.

Eventually you can get out of posting content on your page because you will be to busy running everyone else's.

And congrats on your success! You have won the game.people get paid 200k a month on onlyfans? is this for real?.Any time I hear something like this, I'm always super curious about what exactly you do to set yourself apart from the millions of other content creators. Because, you're right - people probably think it's a super easy thing to get into and make a lot of money, but it's really not. 

If you're willing to share what kind of niche you found for yourself to be able to experience this kind of growth, it'd be really interesting to hear. But, I understand if you feel that it sort of endagers your anonymity or future potential earnings and would rather not divulge. 

Either way, huge congrats on your success. I feel like people often look at those who do OF as ""less than,"" to an extent, like they have to do OF because they can't do anything else. But you've clearly got a good head on your shoulders. 

Enjoy FIRE!.Fantastic job! But beware the lifestyle creep. I once had a neighbor that danced in clubs (totally different from OF I know), but she bought a new BMW every year. She was always on the wrong side of the depreciation curve. üò¶

I want to second /u/TheZapster's comment about starting a services and consulting business to other OF artists. I suspect many of them are making decent money for the first time in their life and need some guidance.

""Those people that are always hanging around? Kick them out. They're taking advantage of you."".You are not very specific on what you do and on your expenses, but my understanding is that overall your business generate in the order of magnitude of 1 million savings a year after taxes. And that's after paying your employees.

You already have enough to stop working but you may want to work more years because the income so great, especially for 2 hours a day.

If you are reasonable you will not have to care for money for life and will be able to do whatever you want.

Congratulations."
