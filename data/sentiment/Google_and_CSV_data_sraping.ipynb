You guys got just the superficial knowledge of value investing, likes doing complex discount cash flows calculations, and buy all these decaying crappy small caps companies no one even heard about.

      "Here’s the deal. Search ads are massively profitable, they require the user to click on links for information, and Google gets paid for each click. Chatbots using retrievable augmented generation give you the answer to your query directly, and references the websites that the knowledge was retrieved from and used to create the summary answer. This doesn’t require the user to click on anything. The cost to serve up answers to these queries is much higher than the cost to serve up a page of links where the first 5 are “sponsored”. If you’re not the monopoly power in this game, you can afford to subsidize the queries until the marginal cost drops to zero, which it will very soon. Google has 90pct margins in search ads due to monopoly pricing. Once the monopoly is broken, price will fall to the marginal cost, which is zero. It’s a binary, existential risk for googles main profit engine. The minute the monopoly is broken due to new entrants and a new form of search, which we can call “ask engines”, Google has no choice but to lower prices, and that doesn’t even solve the shift away from traditional search. They are very reluctant to simply change search and make it more like perplexity or copilot because it means much lower ad revenue and much higher server costs at scale. Investors don’t like that, they are hooked on monopoly profits. It’s just economics, it’s not their fault. They will run down search to zero revenues and milk whatever they can out of it, and they will be very careful about disrupting their own golden goose, but the competition is here and it’s hungry, fast, and totally focused on reinventing search as we know it. <re.Match object; span=(17, 23), match='Search'>\n",

There’s a few issues with investing into Nvidia that few will say as it fundamentally hurts them, and if you want my opinion on what those things are, I’ll give it to you. Firstly, Nvidia has an extremely high Gross and Net profit margin. For the success of the company, this is fantastic, but for the shareholder it’s actually not. If you look at any company in existence, you’ll find that when stability is reached net profit margins almost never exceed 30%, so when the company is currently sitting at a roughly 60% margin, it can be assumed that this is very unlikely to be kept up. If Nvidia still retains market dominance, but its margins go to a still very high but more realistic level of say 30%, it means that Nvidia will have to earn twice as much revenue for the same amount of profits. Nvidia may be far ahead of their competition, but they don’t sit in an industry where market dominance is a guarantee, if a competitor comes out with technology of near equal or greater strength than their own, that competitor will take their position. This issue also stems into the next one they face, which is that they are a back door company, and what I mean by that is their primary consumer is not people but rather corporations. One of the reason that the large tech companies have been able to retain their dominance is in the human psyche, and it’s that humans are inherently stubborn and bendable to societal norms. Take Apple for this examples, their business is almost 100% selling to products to people, and it’s frequently noted how they sell things for considerably more than their competitors and offer significantly less while doing it. For Apple, this has not been an issue, because the vast majority of people are not so checked into technology that they are aware of their products deficiencies, and even if they are aware they don’t really care, and will still buy the product for other reason like the familiarity or green text bubble that Apple users will see if they switch to android. Nvidia on the other hand, is in the exact opposite position of Apple, their success is almost entirely driven on their products performance. If a competitor emerges with new technology that is functionally superior, those who buy their products will act rationally and buy the competitors products instead. For Nvidia to retain market dominance, they legitimately have to be better than their competition, and every time their competition gets better it eats away at them. If Nvidia is 2 years ahead of any competition, that only means the company has 2 years of dominance left, they can obviously extend this whenever they improve upon their own technology which they certainly have been doing and will continue to try and do, but it puts a great deal of uncertainty on their future.\n",

      "\n",
      "1) AI responses were submitted in online exams for open-ended/essay questions, **not** as essays. There were 1,134 \"real\" submissions and 63 AI submissions from the researchers. I point this out because it's likely harder to discern a pattern in one paragraph of text than it is in several pages of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) We do not know if some of the 1,134 submissions deemed as \"real\" were also AI submitted by the students. This would decrease the reported detection rate. The authors discuss this issue and say that 74% of students surveyed said they would use AI in a future course (meaning a lot of them probably did use AI).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The university had no AI detection software (not sure this would have helped, anyway), so detection was by eye only.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) The university's policy for AI was basically that it's \"not allowed\" and that professors should keep an eye out for it. The authors do not assess how the university's stated policies and actual practices may differ, i.e. professors may be pressured to turn a blind eye in order to keep enrollment numbers up, thereby giving a false impression of the reported detection rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Adding on to that, it is well known issue that online courses are the most likely to suffer from AI submissions. It's very possible (I'd argue likely) that professors are overwhelmed and burned out by AI submissions and are simply choosing not to pursue the matter.

      "Hi. I am an options trader at an investment bank. What you see there are the listed options for the dec27th expiry for alphabet. You can either buy or sell the options but it is important to remember that if you sell them there is no limit to your potential losses if you are selling them naked (which means you have no stock position behind). You also need to take into account the volatility of the stock as that is the biggest factor in determining the time value of that option. Other factors could be dividends (although not in the case of alphabet), interest rates and repo rates. Honestly in my opinion unless you really understand options it is best to go very very careful if at all. I would find some videos etc and learn a bit more. There are loads of interesting options strategies that you can use so it is well worth investing a bit of time to it but you need to do a lot more research than just asking people on here. <re.Match object; span=(119, 127), match='alphabet'>\n",

      "> “I think 2025 will be critical,” Pichai said. “I think it’s really important we internalize the urgency of this moment, and need to move faster as a company. The stakes are high.

      "> Pichai’s comments come after a year packed with some of the most intense pressure Google has experienced since going public two decades ago. While areas like search ads and cloud produced strong revenue growth, competition picked up in Google’s core markets, and the company faced internal challenges including culture clashes and concerns about Pichai’s vision for the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "> In August, a federal judge ruled that Google illegally holds a monopoly in the search market.

In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "> That same month, Britain’s competition watchdog issued a statement of objections over Google’s ad tech practices, which the regulator provisionally found are impacting competition in the U.K.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “It’s not lost on me that we are facing scrutiny across the world,” Pichai said. “It comes with our size and success. It’s part of a broader trend where tech is now impacting society at scale. So more than ever, through this moment, we have to make sure we don’t get distracted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Google’s search business still has dominant market share, but generative AI has served up all sorts of new ways for people to access online information, and has brought with it a host of new competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "> OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the hype cycle in late 2022, and investors including Microsoft\n",
      " have since propelled the company to a $157 billion valuation. In July, OpenAI announced it would launch a search engine of its own. Perplexity is also promoting its AI-powered search service and recently closed a $500 million funding round at a $9 billion valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Google is investing heavily to try and stay on top, principally through Gemini, its AI model. The Gemini app gives users access to a number of tools, including Google’s chatbot.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Pichai said “building big, new business” is a top priority. That includes the Gemini app, which executives said they see as Google’s next app to reach half a billion users. The company currently has 15 apps that have hit that mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “With the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months,” Pichai said. “But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year,” Pichai later added.\n",
      "\n",
      "> At the meeting, Pichai showed a chart of large language models, with Gemini 1.5 leading OpenAI’s GPT and other competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “I expect some back and forth” in 2025, Pichai said. “I think we’ll be state of the art.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> He acknowledged that Google has had to play catchup.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “In history, you don’t always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,” he said. “I think that’s what 2025 is all about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Executives took questions that were submitted by employees through Google’s internal system. One comment read aloud by Pichai suggested that ChatGPT “is becoming synonymous to AI the same way Google is to search,” with the questioner asking, “What’s our plan to combat this in the upcoming year? Or are we not focusing as much on consumer facing LLM?”\n",
      "\n",
      "> For the answer, Pichai turned to DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis, who said that teams are going to “turbo charge” the Gemini app and that the company has seen progress in the number of users since launching the app in February. He said “the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Hassabis described a vision for a universal assistant that “can seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Project Astra, Google’s experimental version of a universal assistant that the company announced in May, will be updated in the first half of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Another employee question asked whether Google will be able to get AI products to scale without charging $200 a month “like other companies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Right now, we don’t have any plans for this kind of subscription level,” Hassabis responded, adding that he thinks the $20 monthly charge for Gemini advanced is a good value. “I wouldn’t necessarily say never but there are no plans for that at the moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Toward the end of the meeting, Google welcomed to the stage Josh Woodward, the head of Google Labs. He took the microphone as the Zombie Nation song “Kernkraft 400” played loudly in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Woodward started by showing off Jules, a coding assistant that’s in a trusted tester’s program. He said, “It’s where the future of software development is headed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Woodward then shifted to AI notetaking product NotebookLM, which featured a series of updates in 2024, including a podcasting tool. Woodward demonstrated how the company is trying a new feature that allows the user to “call in” to a podcast. \n",
      "\n",
      "> He then moved onto Project Mariner, an AI-powered multi-tasking Chrome extension. Woodward asked it to add the top restaurants from Tripadvisor\n",
      " to the Maps app. After a brief pause, the demo successfully worked, leading employees in attendance to erupt in applause.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Throughout the meeting, Pichai kept reminding employees of the need to “stay scrappy.” Google has gone through an extensive phase of cost cutting that included eliminating about 6% of its workforce in 2023 and a continued focus on efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "> At one point, Pichai referenced Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who started the company 26 years ago, long before cloud computing or AI tools existed. <re.Match object; span=(2, 8), match='Google'>\n",

      "> Google’s search business still has dominant market share, but generative AI has served up all sorts of new ways for people to access online information, and has brought with it a host of new competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "> OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the hype cycle in late 2022, and investors including Microsoft\n",
      " have since propelled the company to a $157 billion valuation. In July, OpenAI announced it would launch a search engine of its own. Perplexity is also promoting its AI-powered search service and recently closed a $500 million funding round at a $9 billion valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Google is investing heavily to try and stay on top, principally through Gemini, its AI model. The Gemini app gives users access to a number of tools, including Google’s chatbot.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Pichai said “building big, new business” is a top priority. That includes the Gemini app, which executives said they see as Google’s next app to reach half a billion users. The company currently has 15 apps that have hit that mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “With the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months,” Pichai said. “But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year,” Pichai later added.\n",
      "\n",
      "> At the meeting, Pichai showed a chart of large language models, with Gemini 1.5 leading OpenAI’s GPT and other competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “I expect some back and forth” in 2025, Pichai said. “I think we’ll be state of the art.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> He acknowledged that Google has had to play catchup.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “In history, you don’t always need to be first but you have to execute well and really be the best in class as a product,” he said. “I think that’s what 2025 is all about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Executives took questions that were submitted by employees through Google’s internal system. One comment read aloud by Pichai suggested that ChatGPT “is becoming synonymous to AI the same way Google is to search,” with the questioner asking, “What’s our plan to combat this in the upcoming year? Or are we not focusing as much on consumer facing LLM?”\n",
      "\n",
      "> For the answer, Pichai turned to DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis, who said that teams are going to “turbo charge” the Gemini app and that the company has seen progress in the number of users since launching the app in February. He said “the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Hassabis described a vision for a universal assistant that “can seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Project Astra, Google’s experimental version of a universal assistant that the company announced in May, will be updated in the first half of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Another employee question asked whether Google will be able to get AI products to scale without charging $200 a month “like other companies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Right now, we don’t have any plans for this kind of subscription level,” Hassabis responded, adding that he thinks the $20 monthly charge for Gemini advanced is a good value. “I wouldn’t necessarily say never but there are no plans for that at the moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Toward the end of the meeting, Google welcomed to the stage Josh Woodward, the head of Google Labs. He took the microphone as the Zombie Nation song “Kernkraft 400” played loudly in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Woodward started by showing off Jules, a coding assistant that’s in a trusted tester’s program. He said, “It’s where the future of software development is headed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Woodward then shifted to AI notetaking product NotebookLM, which featured a series of updates in 2024, including a podcasting tool. Woodward demonstrated how the company is trying a new feature that allows the user to “call in” to a podcast. \n",
      "\n",
      "> He then moved onto Project Mariner, an AI-powered multi-tasking Chrome extension. Woodward asked it to add the top restaurants from Tripadvisor\n",
      " to the Maps app. After a brief pause, the demo successfully worked, leading employees in attendance to erupt in applause.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Throughout the meeting, Pichai kept reminding employees of the need to “stay scrappy.” Google has gone through an extensive phase of cost cutting that included eliminating about 6% of its workforce in 2023 and a continued focus on efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "> At one point, Pichai referenced Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who started the company 26 years ago, long before cloud computing or AI tools existed.\n",

Once you know the percentages maybe divide the IV by those?? IDK if thats too easy or basic to explain.

Just absolutely no sense of what's important. They loved to play blame game with me. I remember the meeting that I realized it's a lose lose situation.

When a state can fine you for picking the wrong dr on an order or for errors caught before a patient picks up the order, that's nothing more than a cash cow at the expense of the pharmacist. Every application for the rest of my life I'll have to say yes I was the subject of state sanctioned discipline. You'll never get the chance to say \"it was because I put James Wang MD instead of James Wong MD\". Basically a scarlet letter. Even if it means I leave the profession, I'll never participate in that. None\n",

She proceeded to apologize, tell me she will call her insurance, told me I am doing a good job, and told the manager we need more staff in the pharmacy and that this is ridiculous.

      "I cried at work. I’m front of a ton of people. Was a rough day. This patient who is always upset at the pharmacy, it’s always a problem for them. no matter what we did, it was wrong. There were a few times that things happened and it was genuinely frustrating for them which I completely understand but not much we could have done to prevent it or fix it. Just a lot of unfortunate circumstances and of course on my worst day this person showed up and started yelling while I was digging through 30+ warehouse totes looking for THEIR drug. I finally had enough of them berating me while I was elbow deep in drugs FOR THEM. I lost track of how many times I told them “I understand you’re upset I’m doing the best I can to help you can you give me a minute to try and resolve this?” And while they continued to berate me for how terrible this pharmacy was, I took the tote I was digging through, dropped it on the floor and announced to my techs and anyone in earshot that I needed to step out or I was going to say something to someone that I would regret. Was already crying at that point, walked right past that patient (who hadn’t stopped yelling at me either) straight into the break room and cried. Caught my breath, calmed down, came back, patient had chilled out a bit too and they tried to apologize for making me cry. I told them no, I don’t want to hear their fake apology. They were rude to me on more than one occasion despite the pharmacy doing far more than we should have to try and help them. They weren’t sorry for how they acted, never were. They were the kind of people who were proud of how they acted. they were sorry they got an outcome they didn’t expect (the outcome they expect being to fix all of their problems 🙄) and so I told them I don’t want their fake apology and I would do what I could for them right then and they can leave and find another pharmacy because I won’t be filling for them in the future.

      "Patient/customer here….that is just awful! I’m so sorry you have to deal with that kinda crap from a disrespectful, entitled person. As a patient who takes a lot of meds for a chronic condition, I actually thought it was a great idea when CVS and other pharmacies started doing the set lunch time close for 30-60min (I think just 30 with most). I figure that way, everyone gets to take a break and not worry about like 1 person trying to field everyone with staggered breaks. Everyone who works any job deserves a break and I thought this was a great idea to just set a time for everyone. And it’s not like this is something new, pharmacies have been doing this for quite some time so come on people, f-ing plan ahead! <re.Match object; span=(239, 242), match='CVS'>\n",

As an example a person who no longer comes to our Pharmacy couldn't reach their own Pharmacy but decided that we were the appropriate people to call to ask questions about the medications that we no longer dispense for them.

      "1.) Adherence. Studies show people take there meds more often if they have them. Giving them more per fill help them have it and be more compliant.\n",

      "2 ) Money. Getting paid for 90 days up front is a plus, but the real money has been in year end bonuses from medicare plans for driving adherence. I hear these are going away, so chains will probably be pulling back on their adherence focus because it won't drive profit as much.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) Efficiency.  Pharmacies are drowning. Most have way too much work and not enough staff. This is going to continue to worsen as more and more people are on chronic meds (the stimulant explosion and glp1 craze are making this much worse). Major chains are closing stores, so there are more patients at fewer pharmacies. Every 90 day fill removes 2 transactions from the next couple months. Multiply that 250 times a day every day and converting maintenance med patients to 90 day is the only way we will ever have a chance at meeting demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "We don't have time to call around for stimulant patients. I don't have enougb to do what I already need to every day and I can't possibly track down impossible to find meds for each of the 30+ people calling every day looking for focalin, Ritalin la, vyvanse, concerta, adderall, etc. It's not because I'm mean or uncaring, I just literally don't have the time or staffing available to do it. None\n",
      "Some times a pt may be enrolled in a maintenance choice plan where after so many fills of 30 day supply, insurance requires 90 days supply for them to pay for it. The alternative is having the patient call insurance and opt out of said plan, especially when you are trying out a new drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "regarding the 30 days plus 2 refills, some states (like texas) do not allow for us to convert that into a 90 day supply unless we notify the prescriber, especially if they are psyche meds. this is state law None\n",
      "In addition to the other accurate comments, given your specialty, you do not have to give 90! Feel free to do 3 scripts of 30 with a DNF date in the other 2. We have loads of psych patients who get a 30 day supply with no refill (Bupenorphrine, I’m talking to you!). I’ve had patients who get to the prompt on the register about 90 days or do you want us to call the doc for a refill and they tell us no because they’re not sure they will continue (eg trying a new med).  \n",

      "Which pharmacy school? my professors said the same shit about me but when you’re cramming the volume of information required for exams, things tend to go in one ear and out the next. Every pharmacist thinks what they know is the most important crap in the history of the profession but what they know is just an extremely narrow slice. People tend to also have a bias that what they don’t know is not important or relevant to them, therefore not important or relevant to anyone else. Ask an ID clinical pharmacist who was doing nothing but ID for two decades about OTC recommendations and I bet they also would have no clue how to answer. Same guy will grill you and be disappointed in the quality of pharmacists because you don’t know the niche shit that only they care about. I’m willing to bet that you’d also come off as an idiot if I put you in my role for a day.

      "Having worked in drug development for decades, I can tell you that the failure rate of new drugs is much greater than the 90% that is frequently quoted. What ends up happening with many small companies that do develop a successful drug is that they have trouble raising enough money for the final phases of development. They therefore end up partnering with and/or being purchased by one of the majors. Some of the major players have a business model a bit more slanted toward making purchases of other companies. Pfizer is an example. That is the kind of thing I would want to buy.\n",

      "I'm getting a bit old to invest in individual stocks at any significant level, but if I wanted to invest in the aging of the population, I personally would adopt a long-term strategy, sticking to big pharma or big device companies, not the smaller players. Despite the potential for a huge payoff when investing in small biotechs and one-trick ponies, the risks are incredibly high. The health insurance landscape, as mentioned above, is just a bunch of players who do the same things trying to get on top of each other, mostly without success. It's like trying to invest in grocery stores: the space is cutthroat. Margins are low and will likely remain low.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government, at least in the US, cannot nationalize companies at will, except under dire circumstances. I wouldn't spend any time worrying about that. Yes, Medicare prices may get negotiated, but there will be limits on what can be done there because we really need these pharma companies. Most of the breakthroughs are taking place there; universities and government are not as well-funded, not as willing to take risks, and are frequently too bureaucratic to get stuff done quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To purchase large pharma companies, find those that are out of favor and sit through a few quarters. The pendulum will swing back, and you will have bought at a low point and collected some nice dividends for waiting. Unlike tiny companies, these companies can afford a few development failures. The market is focused on a short-term horizon and on who has a deep bench of patents. The market seems to forget that big companies can simply buy out other companies, instantly improving that bench. If you can focus on the medium or long term instead of the short term, you can make good money in this space. Just as a recent example, you had some good opportunities with GILD and JNJ getting beaten up over the last few years. None\n",

      "You can't just live off the interest as you will get destroyed by inflation. You need to do standard FIRE math, check out firecalc, etc. The good news is your numbers work. Put everything in low MER total market index funds. Pull 36k per year from investments which is 3.6% of your fund. Should have almost 0 risk of ruin if you run it in firecalc. You can index that 36k to inflation and still be fine. So every year your budget goes up by the inflation number.

      "I'm just gonna pull one of my older comments on this, because CVS is one of the most talked about companies \n",
      "\n",
      "CVS is a great play based on their value and future prospects. Currently, they have 3 sectors: Pharmacy, PBM/personal care, and Aetna. The pharmacy side of the business is the one that most customers see, so it's the part of the business that most people think about when they think of CVS. This is a mistake. The pharmacy is actually the smallest part of their business. It grows at a steady pace, and CVS knows that they need to get more efficient in this market, which is why they're making moves to close certain stores. What's not acceptable is just how understaffed and understocked the stores are, which are a clear failure of upper management, and a major risk to the business. Still, in upper class area, CVS stores are actually really well run. I've been to CVS stores all across Cali and the surrounding states, and there is a stark difference between a CVS in a well off, high traffic area, and one in a lower traffic area. I'd hope to see progress to balance out these discrepancies, but I digress. The PBM business is the most lucrative, but they're recently come under fire. This business could be at regulatory risk, but CVS management has continually proved that regulatory risks and setbacks with customers(blue shield in Cali) are overblown, and can be managed. The Oakstreet and Signify acquisitions have helped to turbo boost revenue growth, and long term could prove to be great acquisitions. My favorite part of the business is Aetna. This arm of the business is super well run, and has a really long runway. Aetna is the 3rd largest player in healthcare, right behind Humana and UNH. Aetna Revenue has been exploding as of recent, and even with the slowdowns in Medicaid spend, long term the company will be in a strong position here. Overall, the biggest issue for CVS is not their debt. The debt is actually quite manageable for the business based on their current cash flows and future cash flows. No, the biggest issue for CVS is margins. With CVS buying as many companies as they have been and racking up so much debt, they've run into major issues getting their margins up. Currently, they have major structural issues related to integrating Aetna, Oakstreet, Caremark, pharmacy, Signify, and more, all under one roof. Even when revenue has been growing by double digits(even with over 350 billion in sales) it doesn't matter if their net margins keep declining. Luckily, CVS management knows that these margin issues are the biggest issues to address, and the company should be taking active steps, both now, and in the future, to get to industry averages(5-7%). These margin increases will be the major driver for the company, not acquisitions or revenue growth. <re.Match object; span=(62, 65), match='CVS'>\n",

      "CVS is a great play based on their value and future prospects. Currently, they have 3 sectors: Pharmacy, PBM/personal care, and Aetna. The pharmacy side of the business is the one that most customers see, so it's the part of the business that most people think about when they think of CVS. This is a mistake. The pharmacy is actually the smallest part of their business. It grows at a steady pace, and CVS knows that they need to get more efficient in this market, which is why they're making moves to close certain stores. What's not acceptable is just how understaffed and understocked the stores are, which are a clear failure of upper management, and a major risk to the business. Still, in upper class area, CVS stores are actually really well run. I've been to CVS stores all across Cali and the surrounding states, and there is a stark difference between a CVS in a well off, high traffic area, and one in a lower traffic area. I'd hope to see progress to balance out these discrepancies, but I digress. The PBM business is the most lucrative, but they're recently come under fire. This business could be at regulatory risk, but CVS management has continually proved that regulatory risks and setbacks with customers(blue shield in Cali) are overblown, and can be managed. The Oakstreet and Signify acquisitions have helped to turbo boost revenue growth, and long term could prove to be great acquisitions. My favorite part of the business is Aetna. This arm of the business is super well run, and has a really long runway. Aetna is the 3rd largest player in healthcare, right behind Humana and UNH. Aetna Revenue has been exploding as of recent, and even with the slowdowns in Medicaid spend, long term the company will be in a strong position here.

      "Much of what is propping up Cocoa prices is pure speculation. That’s why it took Cocoa traders about a month to realize production is up, and why this week alone it fell from its new ATH of $12k/MT to $9k/MT. They focused on the headline around Thanksgiving time that stated cocoa production estimates were 50 metric tons below targets, versus seeing that the estimated production was still clearly up 30%+ YOY depending on the producing region.

      "be different. There will be gross margin compression next year, and this should be about the time where the market reacts negatively.

      "A few key things about the business. Reeces by itself is about 30% of sales. Along Kisses which are about 20%+, and Kit Kats which are 5%, you’re talking about a business whose major products make up the majority of sales, and these products cannot be substituted. Monopoly-like qualities is what you want. That will get the business through current industry challenges.\n",

      "80%+ of sales are North American confectionary. International doesn’t matter, because you cannot expand chocolate and candy geographically. Regional preference is incredibly strong. Just ask Warren Buffett why they couldn’t expand Sees very well, even within the US. \n",

      "Since 2017, the current CEO changed course a bit. Thats why you all the sudden see net margins start to spike. She put a stop to the wasteful international focus, and started focusing on acquiring popular snack labels and ballooning them up to Hersheys distribution scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, pretax earnings to net fixed assets is about 70%. That’s incredibly efficient and it’s because of some of their durable competitive advantages. Also, incredibly high ROIC for decades and decades. That’s what gives it compounding potential. However with mergers and acquisitions being capital allocation priority #3 of 4, M&A is always a dual edged sword due to the risk of overpaying and underproducing new assets/brands. None\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What would really reassure me was if I had confidence they had good management and the management was innovating or at least doing a good job maintaining their brand image (e.g. Hershey's spends 0 effort trying to greenwash their cocoa).  At this point, I could easily see the chocolate industry going the way of the beer industry where industry giants have continually lost marketshare to craft breweries or exotic Mexican imports.  Hershey's should have a moat but I think their primary advantage is their scale letting them undercut competitors on price.  That's not a strong position (looks at Nissan). None\n",
      "It is ok. Not value territory yet imo. Paying 19x earnings for 3-4% revenue growth and like 5-6% operating income growth that will probably decelerate going forward is probably not the best bet but i think you can definitely squeeze 9-10% returns out of it at this price, like 4% earnings growth with 2-3% buybacks and 3% dividends, maybe also some multiples expansion if market gets euphoric again about it.

      "Branding has less value than it used to have for packaged food companies & it's a less effective moat.  I think the primary reason for this is that Walmart and Costco now offer quality products under their own brands. They are going to continue to take market share from established packaged food brands.  \n",

      "Pretty much all major branded food companies have greatly underperformed in the past 5 years: KHC, MDLZ, CAG, GIS, K, and HSY.  Some of these companies may be worth considering now for a small part of a portfolio because they are very cheap now and they are defensive. I personally hold CAG.  But growth potential for them is generally very limited. None\n",
