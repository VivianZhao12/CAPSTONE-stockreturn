Amazon.com Inc. has been talking with wireless carriers about offering low-cost or possibly free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers, according to people familiar with the situation. The company is negotiating with Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Dish Network Corp. to get the lowest possible wholesale prices. That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.

The talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said. Dish shares jumped 14% Friday in New York since a deal with the retail giant could help the struggling satellite-TV company as it transitions to become a national wireless carrier. Meanwhile, T-Mobile fell 8.4%, AT&T dropped 5% and Verizon slid 3.5.%. The big three national carriers could see their own subscribers flee to a cheaper option at Amazon. Deutsche Telekom AG, which holds a majority stake in T-Mobile, fell 5.7% in Germany. “We are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don’t have plans to add wireless at this time,” Amazon spokesperson Maggie Sivon said in a statement. Verizon and Dish declined to comment.

Amazon’s US Prime subscribers pay $139 a year for privileges like speedy free delivery, video streaming and access to 100 million songs. Analysts say Prime membership has stagnated in the country since Amazon boosted the annual price from $119, a sign that a subscription is less attractive to consumers struggling with a stubbornly high inflation rate. About 167 million Amazon shoppers had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Amazon is competing with Walmart Inc., whose $98-a-year Walmart+ membership is emerging as a lower-cost alternative offering many of the same perks as Prime and free grocery delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon in February increased its free grocery delivery threshold to $150 from $35. For the wireless industry, an Amazon deal could be seen as a welcome boost to wholesale revenue and a way to attract more traffic to newly expanded 5G networks. But Amazon’s entry could be detrimental if Prime wireless becomes popular and starts to chip away at the big carriers’ customer base.

A deeply below-market price from one of the world’s largest retailers could easily undercut the pricing power of the big three national carriers, making it tempting for subscribers to go to Amazon. Unlimited plans start at $60 a month at Verizon and T-Mobile, with AT&T starting at $65. Anytime Amazon enters a new market, it sends shivers through the industry because the Seattle-based retail giant has shown it’s willing to absorb billions of dollars in shipping and movie production costs to fuel Prime membership growth. Wireless service could be just one more item that Amazon’s willing to take a hit on if it gives the company a leg up versus Walmart."

Bloomberg described the forthcoming lawsuit as ""the big one,"" following several earlier lawsuits filed by the FTC under Chair Lina Khan.

""In the coming weeks, the agency plans to file a far-reaching antitrust suit focused on Amazon's core online marketplace, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg and three people familiar with the case,"" the report said.

Khan may try to force Amazon to ""restructure"" its business. ""Based on her public comments, Khan is unlikely to accept compromises from Amazon and could seek to restructure the company—a dramatic outcome that Amazon would surely appeal,"" Bloomberg wrote.

First year, is always rough.  But things will get better from there as you learn to source, analyze, and make connection with suppliers. Then you will see real growth.

Could probably retire pretty happy now. All this was due to Amazon income. (But to be honest, 2020 and 2021 was the best years for Amazon, Probably made 35-40% of my net worth during those two years.)

Also, don't put all your eggs in one basket, Amazon could suspend your account one day and take everything away. So once you start making money, look for other avenue of money makers such as rentals/stocks. and build those out.","I know the question is dumb

These kinds of posts tend to elicit responses from people making grandiose claims about their sales figures and give lengthy blurbs of positivity with either no-substantive advice, only minimal simplistic advice, or just plain BAD advice. ***These are often attempts to target you for sales and scams*** such as courses, groups for leads run by those selling the products, info farming, and other scumbaggery. These have proven at times to be wholesalers, distributors, or manufacturers deceptively representing themselves to gain a foothold with potential buyers. All of these frequently are not people who sell on Amazon, but prey on those who do.

2023-07-25,stocks,amazon should dump their retail operations into a new company and just focus on AWS,"The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

2023-07-25,stocks,Lol yeah right break up amazon they couldn’t even break up meta who has done more harm with it’s leading social media position but yeah ok lina you taking down amazon now 🙄,"The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.

The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.
The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.

The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.

The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.

In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

2023-07-26,stocks,"I honestly don't see why Amazon needs the other 2 companies for this. One of the main reasons I use Google Maps is because it works so well with Google Assistant. Whether I am at home or away, I can ask Google to look up certain places, call certain places for me, get me directions, etc. 

Lots of people use Alexa as their chosen voice assistant at home, but Alexa doesn't do much when you're away from home. Basically useless for anything mobile other than playing music. Alexa would absolutely dominate if it had more use on the go... and having good, reliable mapping data is absolutely crucial to that.","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html

Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million “points of interest,” such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.

Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. “We have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,” Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, “Can we just get collaboration around the open base map?” Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.

For many companies, Google’s and Apple’s maps aren’t ideal, because they don’t provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. “That works for a lot of people, but not for others,” Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it."

2023-08-23,ecommerce,"Let me break down my experience with Amazon for you friend. 

&#x200B;

A few years ago I was selling many things on Amazon, anything really I could get my hands on. There was a bundle set of rolling papers that we had purchased from verified suppliers by the manufacturer. at the time we were doing around 3-4k every two weeks. A listing, and not a product had IP ownership. We got our Amazon account suspended and after gathering all the evidence required (which took weeks) Chasing down invoices, asking suppliers for signed letters to prove authenticity, sending multiple emails explaining the situation. We eventually got our account banned for life.

&#x200B;

Amazon then proceeded to keep 3.8k of our monies (bare in mind this is years ago) and we still have not seen a single penny. We chase this up every few months but due to Amazons terms it is not illegal what they do. 

&#x200B;

My two cents. Selling for Amazon is working for Amazon. You follow Amazon metrics, you answer to them when mistakes come up. Customers win 99% percent of cases even if you can prove them wrong. The fees are MASSIVE, the competition is steep and most of the time you are battling with a manufacture/supplier of the product who sells under a different name to make more profit.

&#x200B;

All in all, sell for yourself, grow for yourself and make your own dreams come true. Remember you are an entrepreneur for a reason and it is not to work for someone else again. 

&#x200B;

TL/DR: Amazon stole from me, taught me a valuable lesson and left me salty.","I've had my own shopify store for almost 3 months which i know isn't long but i'm just not good at google ad search campaigns and all that stuff (5% CTR spent £130 which i know isn't a lot but i was expecting at least 1 sale by now so clearly watching youtube tutorials doesn't mean you're not shit at ads lol).

2023-09-24,smallbusiness,"It depends on your risk tolerance. Just like any business every sales channel has its own risk factors. 

Amazon - they own your customer but there are hundreds of millions of customers on the platform. They store and fulfill your orders. But again, they own the customer not you.

Shopify - you are responsible for traffic to your website and products but you own the customer (ie email, address and phone number). You will need a 3PL (3rd party logistics - think Amazon fulfillment but a private company) to fulfill your orders. It can be difficult to get traffic to your website/products.

Best case would have a mix of both to mitigate your risk. More and more of the aggregators in the space are looking for a mix of both rather than just 100% Amazon only. 

Even more, products with (subscription) monthly recurring revenue are even more attractive, ie something consumable that needs to be ordered monthly like supplements. 

That doesn’t mean a business without a 2nd sales channel is a bad business. You can always build out that 2nd sales channel. It’s very dependent from business to business. 

DM me if you have any more questions. Hope this helps.","I’m a business buyer starting to consider e-commerce businesses as acquisition targets. It seems like every business listing I review has their product on Amazon.

2023-09-25,smallbusiness,"What stops me from buying a Amazon FBA business is the low margins and Amazon's lack of seller support. After COGS, FBA fees/ads you're likely sub 20% margin. They will shut your account down (sometimes due to violations of seller policies,  like primary photo not having an all white background) and just showing thr item. You'll have to fight to get it back. Could take weeks or months to get it back, meanwhile you're entire revenue source is shut down.

There are ways to mitigate other risks, like branding, to report knock offs and listing hijacking. As others have mentioned, you have benefits like massive audience and your audience is mostly at the bottom of the sales funnel.  

I would be more inclined to buy a FBA business if I was very adept at expanding product channels, like to my own website and I owned other website that I could point existing and well trafficked articles (organic traffic) to my product website. Being solely beholden to the whims of one corporation sounds like a huge risk to me.


I would recommend listening to some podcasts about Amazon FBA businesses from actual owners and advertising managers.","I’m a business buyer starting to consider e-commerce businesses as acquisition targets. It seems like every business listing I review has their product on Amazon.

2/ Anthropic then uses that money to pay for AWS usage
3/ Amazon reports large growth in AWS division

Reminds me of how Nvidia ‘invests’ in AI startups that just so happen to need to purchase thousands of Nvidia chips","E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon’s aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet’sGoogle.

Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic’s Claude chatbots.

The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.

Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks. 

This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia’s stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.

To an extent, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic’s AI models via Amazon Bedrock — a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.

Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.

Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.

* Amazon is facing its first set of antitrust charges from the U.S. federal government after the Federal Trade Commission filed its long-anticipated lawsuit against the e-commerce and cloud giant.
* The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.”
* It’s also the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers have seen as anticompetitive practices. 


The Federal Trade Commission has filed its long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.

In a sweeping complaint unveiled Tuesday, the FTC and attorneys general from 17 states accused Amazon of wielding its “monopoly power” to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.

The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon “unlawfully maintains” its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.

Amazon also “effectively requires” that sellers use its “costly” fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.

These tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice “but to rely on Amazon to stay in business.”

The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon’s dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.

Amazon sought Khan’s recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.

The charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up “competitive moats” by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.

At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that “large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”

Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.

Those moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses “strong-arm tactics” to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot

on antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.

Amazon’s marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker “the everything store.”

The third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books. It has also increased the fees it charges sellers to do business on its site, run advertisements, and tap into its fulfillment and delivery services. In the first half of 2023, the company collected a 45% cut of every sale made by sellers in the U.S., up from 19% in 2014, according to the nonprofit Institute for Local Self Reliance. Sales from third-party sellers now comprise 60% of total units sold, the company recently disclosed."

The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon’s dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.

Amazon sought Khan’s recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.

The charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up “competitive moats” by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.

At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that “large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.”

Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.

Those moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses “strong-arm tactics” to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot

on antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.

Amazon’s marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker “the everything store.”

The third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books. It has also increased the fees it charges sellers to do business on its site, run advertisements, and tap into its fulfillment and delivery services. In the first half of 2023, the company collected a 45% cut of every sale made by sellers in the U.S., up from 19% in 2014, according to the nonprofit Institute for Local Self Reliance.

* Amazon is facing its first set of antitrust charges from the U.S. federal government after the Federal Trade Commission filed its long-anticipated lawsuit against the e-commerce and cloud giant.
* The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.”
* It’s also the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers have seen as anticompetitive practices. 


The Federal Trade Commission has filed its long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.

In a sweeping complaint unveiled Tuesday, the FTC and attorneys general from 17 states accused Amazon of wielding its “monopoly power” to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.

The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon “unlawfully maintains” its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.

Amazon also “effectively requires” that sellers use its “costly” fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.

These tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice “but to rely on Amazon to stay in business.”

2023-10-05,technology,"They're alleging that Amazon was using an algorithm that would scrape competitors websites and then *manipulate* the competition's pricing algorithms to push the price higher (presumably through changing Amazon's price and deducing how the competitors price would change?). So Amazon ends up being the cheapest because they trick other websites into going higher and then undercut it?

In a non-digital marketplace, is that illegal? Like, if you think Bob across the street is going to raise his price if you do it, and then while Bob's out to lunch you drop your price down to normal so you're the cheapest again, can you do that? I feel like the problem is that Amazon doesn't actually have any secret knowledge. They can reframe this as competition tripping over their own feet. If Amazon uses some new algorithm, and then competitors prices all start going wonky trying to keep up with it, is that Amazon's fault?

2023-11-19,smallbusiness,"I was selling on Amazon, my staff was working hard to fulfill orders, and the vendors will thrilled with the amount we were buying.  But our wholesale cost is 50% or more of retail price, Amazon takes (I don't remember 15-20%).  And we had to sell under retail to be competitive, so I found there was little in there for us.  Also Amazon makes you take returns on used/broken items that weren't like that when you sent it out.  I got burned on a $800 item, customer returned a similar looking $300 item, still with the pricetags on it from the place he actually bought it.  Amazon told me to go fuck myself.  I decided at that point I didn't want to be in business with them.

We're admittedly small potatoes, so we didn't amount to anything to them.

One final word of caution; if what you're selling is popular Amazon will then go to China and have it made themselves and essentially tell you to go fuck yourself, maybe stealing your manufacturer to boot.

I have no experience selling online, and while it must be worth it with all the people doing it, it also wouldn’t be worth it for Amazon if there weren’t some gotchas. So I guess I am wondering

- What are the average fees that it costs to list product on Amazon? 

- Does anyone else in a similar position have any experience with this?

- And much broader, would it be worth it for us to list these products on Amazon?

2023-11-20,smallbusiness,"This is my experience and others may vary. I am located in Canada

No.  When I tried to dip our companies toes into Amazon the numbers did not make sense. There was only a flat like $6 allowed for shipping costs. Yet my minimum cost to ship was about $18 at the time. So I had to add a further $12 minimum to the sell price. Which kept us competitive price wise. But the second I got orders that were a little further away the cost to ship would jump and it would chew away the profit. 

Add in the products I had on there are a bit niche and 95% of the sales were at Xmas it really was not worth the headache so I shut it down. Hindsight it was the correct move because now there are several main sellers doing the same products and they are doing it WAY cheaper than I ever could. Im not even sure how they manage to sell that cheap as their cost cant be any cheaper than mine is.","Context: Small business that has been around for 40 years selling parts out of a brick and mortar location, and 4 years ago started an online store with great success.

Since stepping down as CEO of Amazon in 2021, Bezos has accelerated his charitable giving, and has said he plans to give away much of his fortune in his lifetime. Bezos and his fiancee Lauren Sanchez in August pledged $100 million to recovery efforts in Maui after deadly wildfires ravaged the Hawaiian island. Bezos has said he sells at least $1 billion of Amazon stock a year to fund his rocket startup, Blue Origin, and in 2020 he launched the $10 billion Earth Fund to combat the effects of climate change.

https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/21/bezos-aggressive-again-tuesday-selling-more-amazon-stock-sources.html","Amazon (AMZN) Founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos is reportedly seeking to sell 8 to 10 million of his Amazon shares — worth up to $1 billion — according to CNBC. Yahoo Finance Live examines the former CEO's timeline of past stock sales while he currently owns 988 million shares in the e-commerce retailer.

Jeff Bezos is reportedly looking to offload more of his stake in Amazon. The former CEO is looking to sell up to 10 million shares. This is according to a report out from CNBC, which comes after he already shelled up just about $240 million worth of the stock last week. Now, Bezos still owns 988 million Amazon shares. That's equal to roughly about 10% stake here in the company.

2023-12-15,ecommerce,"what's the product? Unless it's some kind of branded apparel, or bed sheets, towels, or something (where the material is important) ...most people go on amazon and choose the cheapest. dont they? especially in these times, and increasingly in the future.

also bear in mind all these new competitors on the scene...shein, temu, etc. amazon are going to want to keep their spot. and will increasingly favour the cheaper options imo. over the next few years

$25 to $40 for better quality. on amazon. is a big jump. $30 for 'clearly' better quality/ better features seems more of a draw. depends on the product.

In the last 3 weeks (the busiest time of year) you've only had a few sales. which suggests an issue.","A quick summary is that I launched a product 3 weeks ago priced at $40.  It is higher end than all the competition and better quality.  Some competitors sell in the $40-55 range and get decent sales, but 75% of the competitors are low end and price in the $25-40 range.  Therefore about 75% of the competition is currently priced lower than me.

I enrolled in VINE on Thanksgiving and all 30 giveaways got claimed.  Since then 10 reviews came in and 8 were 5 star, 2 were 4 star (4.8 star rating)

Around Thanksgiving I had 2 quick sales with no advertising, then it completely stopped.   I turned on PPC and built several campaigns and got 4 sales in the first 2 days, now the last few days I've had 0 sales.

So I've basically had 2 organic sales and then 4 in the 3 weeks since the launch.  Now I feel I'm at an all time low as I'm spending money on PPC, and getting 0 sales for several days. (I only spent about $78 and it's at 48% ACOS.)

I've also noticed the ranking showing up in Junglescout went from 229k to 315k the next day and seems to be getting worse.

Is this normal for a new product?  With good reviews and the fast giveaway, I thought I'm worried because it's the holiday season.  Do I need to discount or do a coupon?  I feel it's better quality than the competitors selling it for more than me, but at the same time, it's in the higher range of prices for similar listings.  

By discounting, like going from $40 to $35, I feel could turn off the pending VINE reviewers, so I don't want to make major swings.  My goal price is $45 or more long term.

1. FBA inventory currently around 45 Units
2. A+ Content is not complete, but good quality photos and videos have been made.

1. Discount or Coupons - (would a 10% coupon turn off VINE reviewers?)

2. Spend more money in PPC (How much if it seems to be performing badly?)

3. Finish A+ Content 

4. Send more inventory to Amazon (How much?)

It's a product similar product to a tool caddy.

Do you know as US sellers, if we have the opportunity to sell on these websites as well?  

Have you launched a lot of products on Amazon before?  You sound pretty confident that there's an issue.  Regarding the price, from the sellers selling them $40-65, mine is the highest quality for sure and they are selling between 200-700 a month depending on the seller for most of the higher priced ones.  

I agree with most people going for the cheaper ones in this economy, there also has been a TON of competition added to the cheaper ones since I started researching the product, however there does seem to be a market for the more expensive ones.

2023-12-15,ecommerce,"Good job is for the good reviews that you've got.

Here is my opinions:

Discounts are great to advertise and market leading up to the holiday events. Also, when people leave their cart with items, but don't complete their checkout a lot more sites are sending emails with discounts to help the buyer finish checking out. Also, If you are to do discounts, it's good to announce it in social campaign and email campaign.

Spending money on PPC is worth it if you have good A/B testing system and data to learn from.

Finish A+ Content, this is the cheapest return. If you wisely choose your content you can really save a lot of money that would otherwise go into PPC.

If you send more inventory to Amazon you would want to do a cost analysis; there should be a sweet spot for how much and at what price you will get satisfactory return.

Fundamental opinion, is to focus on branding and customers. Branding is making sure your logo/name is on products and when people see your brand they know and like what it stands for. Focusing on customers means learning from them and knowing what they value and appreciate. That way they can refer your product without you having to spend money.","A quick summary is that I launched a product 3 weeks ago priced at $40.

2023-12-15,ecommerce,"Nope never listed on amazon, just been in ecommerce a long time. only one opinion.

If you've got your PPC listed against your competitors with the the high price, and your product is better, you should be getting a minimum of 6 or 7 sales a day (200 a month - as you mentioned)

You could keep your price as it is, keep running PPC, watch the reviews come in, watch the rankings (amazon adjusts ranking hourly) and see what happens. 3 weeks is not long to say if it's working or not.

Or you could lower the price to what you can afford and still be profitable - and see what happens. Yep if you do this, do it after more Vine reviews have come in.

If it was me I'd wait 3 weeks, and see how the ranking changes. watch the reviews come in. If you dont get up to 6 a day by then, lower the price

1. FBA inventory currently around 45 Units
2. A+ Content is not complete, but good quality photos and videos have been made.

I feel the options are: 

1. Discount or Coupons - (would a 10% coupon turn off VINE reviewers?)

2. Spend more money in PPC (How much if it seems to be performing badly?)

3. Finish A+ Content 

4. Send more inventory to Amazon (How much?)

Regarding my options above, does anyone have any opinions on these?  Is there anything you would add to this list?

Thanks a ton for any replies about anything. "

I'm just trying to look at your product as a buyer's eye, and I think you have the price issue too. Your competition prices range from $110 - 150 on average, and you are trying to sell it for $59. I wouldn't go for a product at that price range. I think being that cheap is also repellent for the customers. Another point is; as another commenter said, your hero image and other product photos really look photoshopped, till we see other people in the other photos. This, combined with the cheap price gives me scam vibes. I think you need to look at those points as well. I am very sorry to say this but I think you need brutal honesty.

We have lost thousands of dollars due to damaged items, returns, fraud, and other forms of manipulation. In 98% of cases we filed for those issues only 2% of the time amazon responded on our side.

&#x200B;

We have seen customers order items use them and then return them within 30 days for a year straight with amazon doing nothing about it. To solve this situation we just started cancelling the order for that specific buyer. But they can move addresses and screw you many times before they run out of places to ship to.

We have seen customers order our items and then claim they were never received even when a signature is required and pictures of the item delivered that could be confirmed with Google Earth. With amazon again taking the side of the customer. Though legally this would be classified as fraud.

We had a new experience today when a customer requested a refund because the item was marked delivered when they had not received it. Naturally a refund was processed but then the customer reached out a day later to let us know that the item actually showed up. When we tried to retrieve our funds that were refunded at the demand of the customer we were surprised once again at the protocol amazon has for their sellers. When we tried to submit a safe t claim it did not allow us. When we reached out to customer service they told us that the customer has to contact them and request to be charged for the item. The customer of course did not do this. When reaching out to amazon again about this issue they said this was the only option to retrieve our funds. As usual with amazon and their support team. A complete dead end, waste of time, and a lot of frustration.

My tip if you are new to amazon and excited about the TikTocs you hear about getting rich easily.... is to price your product accordingly. Amazon takes steep fees every step of the way. Their return policy is constantly manipulated, making the sellers be responsible not just for the shipping cost there but the shipping cost back. The more you spend on ads, the more of these types of issues will occur. Most important tip is to check out every other platform and list your products on there. Majority of the time they are a million times better than amazon. Try Walmart, eBay, and even Etsy to push your products through because they will take care of you a million times better than amazon ever will.

&#x200B;

Most importantly remember... aMAZON MAKE ITS MONEY ON YOU THE SELLER, not the buyers. The contract you sign to work with them is as good as the one you will sign with the devil as they will take your money and allow fraud, manipulation, and other losses to you and that contract prevents you from suing them.

2024-01-05,AmazonSeller,"God I wanted to post this exact thing.  I’ve been running a website based business for 10 years with average yearly revenue of $10 million.  We noticed a decline in sales starting in June this year and I finally decided to start selling on Amazon and down the rabbit hole I went.  I experience the exact same things. It took months to even start getting noticed there, then things took off and same thing. We sell 10 SKU’s and only 3 are prime the rest are FBM and we use FedEx and UPS for 90% of the shipments and using the same courier mix on our website sales only maybe 2-3 out of 2,000 weekly shipments get delivered and the customer says they didn’t receive it.  With Amazon we ship maybe 500 boxes a week and at least 20 a week say they didn’t get it and then they want a refund instead.  This never happens from our website.  We lose money on FedEx being late.  Weather delay? Customer gets a refund.  Constant used returns that are unsellable.  We get other vendors items as returns all the time.  Not once have I recovered a cent.  Amazon is current holding $55,000 in reserve money for no reason and I have a health rating of 440.  Yet I have to keep selling bc that’s where people go and to make up the slower web sales this last 6 months Amazon has made it up but at a fraction of the profit. I am non stop on emails bc god forbid I have a day off.  “Over Fucking SLA” every Sunday.","Rant - amazon is a disgusting company for sellers.

They refuse to accept that they either picked the wrong item or some buyers return was not checked when it arrived. I, apparently, now owe them an essay on how Ill ensure (I) dont mess up again…(two weeks n counting)

So all in all, the customer got two items, a refund, and almost got me expelled from FBM….","Rant - amazon is a disgusting company for sellers. We have lost thousands of dollars due to damaged items, returns, fraud, and other forms of manipulation. In 98% of cases we filed for those issues only 2% of the time amazon responded on our side.

&#x200B;

We have seen customers order items use them and then return them within 30 days for a year straight with amazon doing nothing about it. To solve this situation we just started cancelling the order for that specific buyer. But they can move addresses and screw you many times before they run out of places to ship to.

We have seen customers order our items and then claim they were never received even when a signature is required and pictures of the item delivered that could be confirmed with Google Earth. With amazon again taking the side of the customer. Though legally this would be classified as fraud.

We had a new experience today when a customer requested a refund because the item was marked delivered when they had not received it. Naturally a refund was processed but then the customer reached out a day later to let us know that the item actually showed up. When we tried to retrieve our funds that were refunded at the demand of the customer we were surprised once again at the protocol amazon has for their sellers. When we tried to submit a safe t claim it did not allow us. When we reached out to customer service they told us that the customer has to contact them and request to be charged for the item. The customer of course did not do this. When reaching out to amazon again about this issue they said this was the only option to retrieve our funds. As usual with amazon and their support team. A complete dead end, waste of time, and a lot of frustration.

&#x200B;

My tip if you are new to amazon and excited about the TikTocs you hear about getting rich easily.... is to price your product accordingly. Amazon takes steep fees every step of the way. Their return policy is constantly manipulated, making the sellers be responsible not just for the shipping cost there but the shipping cost back. The more you spend on ads, the more of these types of issues will occur. Most important tip is to check out every other platform and list your products on there. Majority of the time they are a million times better than amazon. Try Walmart, eBay, and even Etsy to push your products through because they will take care of you a million times better than amazon ever will.

&#x200B;

Most importantly remember... aMAZON MAKE ITS MONEY ON YOU THE SELLER, not the buyers. The contract you sign to work with them is as good as the one you will sign with the devil as they will take your money and allow fraud, manipulation, and other losses to you and that contract prevents you from suing them. I am hoping some attorneys find the right wording to do a class action soon.

FUCK aMAZON & FUCK THEIR ILL TRAINED CARELESS SUPPORT TEAM.

That concludes my tantrum.  I sincerely hope that the majority of seller's experiences are better than mine."

2024-01-08,ecommerce,Amazon MCF operates in UK.I would check with them first.,"I currently sell exclusively on Amazon and sell in large volume (40-50K unit sales per year). I want to expand my business to eBay and Shopify. The beauty of Amazon is that I can just ship my stuff to their warehouse and they take care of customer orders for me. I'm looking for a similar (and reasonable priced) service that can give me the same benefit in UK. 

From what I understand on eBay (and maybe Shopify too) you have to ensure that tracking status is updated for customers, so I would want the 3rd party service to do this for me. I currently use a 3PL for Amazon - however, they've been extremely slow in recent months and I wouldn't trust them to fulfil my orders. 

Would highly appreciate any recommendations.   "

I don’t mind being back in office but I just wanted to switch offices, I was denied multiple times with some bs about not enough people on my team there.

2024-01-09,ecommerce,Get away from Amazon as soon as possible if you want to grow your business. You can simply setup a Shopify site and plug in FBA fullfillment on the back end to keep using Amazon fullfillment until you find a cheaper 3PL.

You won’t be able to create any kind of customer life value selling thru Amazon not to mention they can end you at any point without notice.,"I currently run a brand that sells exclusively via FBA on Amazon.

For those that sell on and off Amazon, how do you fulfill orders (with the caveat that self-fulfilling isn't an option due to volume)?  Do you use Amazon MCF or a 3PL?  How do your costs to fulfill orders compare to fulfilling through FBA?

With Amazon's new inbound fees, it feels like MCF will become even more expensive (ie, you'll have to bear the cost of inbound fees + MCF shipping fee) unless they lower MCF costs once those fees take effect.

I'd prefer to sell exclusively on Amazon because it keeps things cleaner, but harder to run facebook ads, retargeting ads, get email lists, etc when all traffic is directed to Amazon which is somewhat of a black box with data (attribution info excepted). So, if there are other solutions to this particular problem, I'd love to hear those as well."

If we factor in the labor and packaging materials MCF is cheaper for small orders (up to 3-4 items), but if it's a bigger order let say 10-12 items it can be pretty expensive because they charge per item.

2024-02-02,stocks,"Amazon's a great company, with a strong moat around the cloud business in particular.

Its core ecommerce moat is still extensive, though might come under pressure within 5 years - the competition in this space will likely heat up significantly.

Is it cheaper than Google? Depends on what you look at. By EV/EBITDA, Google is only 17.4X when Amazon is 22.2X, and Amazon's more capital intensive.

Edit: typo","I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.

Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.

AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.

Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.

Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.

Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.

Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.

Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.

Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.

Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was ""only at a PE of 30"" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.

In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.

We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.

AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.

Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.

Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.

Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.

If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.

TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise."
2024-02-02,stocks,Amazon is such a diversified company buying that stock alone puts you in so many different industries,"I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.

Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.

AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.

Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.

Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.

Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here.

I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.

Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.

Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.

Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.

If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices.

Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.

TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers.

Years ago I used Shopify for my small day-planner and stationary business, but I remember it being over the top and expensive for my 3 product SKU business. Since deciding to pursue this new business, Shopify still seems like the industry leader, but I am wondering if its the best option especially if I keep the business small.  I've heard about Amazon fulfillment and I'm curious if that might be a more cost-effective option for me especially since I would rather not fulfill orders myself and I don't mind if it's sold on Amazon exclusively.   
Would Amazon fulfillment be a good fit for my product? Or is there a specific e-commerce platform that you'd suggest I research? I would greatly appreciate any advice or recommendations you can offer.

2024-02-21,stocks,This is going to be huge for Amazon stock. Definitely is going back to 1000 per share in the next 5 years,"Amazon will replace Walgreens Boots Alliance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the 30-stock index, said on Tuesday. Amazon shares moved up 1% in extended trading.

The move will result in more exposure for investors who bet on the index, which is far smaller than the S&P 500.

The change goes into effect prior to market open on Feb. 26.

“Reflecting the evolving nature of the American economy, this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA,” S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement.

The company said the revision was “prompted” by Walmart’s 3-for-1 stock split, resulting in lower index weight for Walmart.

2024-02-20,ecommerce,"Selling on Amazon is a slippery slope. They charge a good chunk off the top with every sale. If you let them warehouse, the fees can add up as they also charge for storage. Plus there is ad spend so people see your offer.  


However, people love prime (fba) and free shipping. So you're trading profit for velocity of sales. The issue is that an unknown brand without reviews won't get many sales, plus your listing needs to be optimized with images and the proper use of bullet points with keywords etc..  


If you ship Amazon orders yourself (fbm), the fees are less (you're paying for shipping so that needs to be calculated into the overall cost). But, your sales will be far less than if you were selling via FBA.

The advice I was given by some of the top guys is to consider Amazon because there’s always spillover from your fb ads and other channels. For instance, after someone sees your fb ads, they search google or Amazon to purchase. I’ve noticed it for my brand name on both channels. 

One way to tell if you have any searches on Amazon is to type in your brand name and if it auto populates, you may have some searches. 

I haven’t leaned into Amazon yet and I used to do FBA as well. I agree with the rest here with high fees but if I can generate extra revenue without too much focus on Amazon and just spill over, I’d be happy with that. Just some food for thought

I worked for a company that sold to Amazon, and the experience of having to deal with all of the counterfeit and grey market items in their marketplace dissuaded me from ever buying from any 3rd party seller there. And since Amazon has made it harder to filter by seller, I've largely stopped buying from them at all.

Analysis:  
  
Amazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:  
  
Expansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.  
  
\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.  
  
""Voluntary"" Use of Amazon Warehouse Distribution (AWD) for FBA Sellers:

\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.  
  
\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.  
  
Implementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:  
  
\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.  
  
\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean—to avoid excessive storage fees—now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.  
  
This policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of ""low inventory"" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.  
  
\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the ""voluntary"" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.  
  
\*\*Overall Financial Impact:\*\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.  
  
Again, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.  
  
Bonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.  
  
Extra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.  
  
Position: 20% of my portfolio is now in AMZN. Even at ATH, I plan to change to 50% weighted in Amazon... This is pissing me off, but I gotta find a way to get my money back somehow."

2024-03-04,stocks,"Don't take this personally, but you (by which I mean 'third party sellers') is why we went from spending high six figures per year through Amazon to zero.  Maybe not you specifically, but many third party merchants range from terrible to crooked.  Amazon became a crapshoot of what product or service you would get.  

Early on we could steer and filter to Amazon-fulfillment only, but they became so integrated with crummy third party sellers that it was impossible to stay clear.  And third party sellers were also infesting Amazon fulfillment, with returns and counterfeit items migrating from the third party side into the Amazon side.  

For perspective, we had direct access to people second to Bezos.  But seeing how Amazon was not only doing little to curb the problem but instead was enabling and expanding them, we went cold turkey.  

So in a sense, we'd agree.  Amazon's rapacious conduct and philosophy is not something I want to do business with, but is something I expected to show up as EPS, and thus grew the equity position.  

At times I've questioned if Amazon's 180 into anti-customer anti-partner anti-everybody practices would sabotage their growth.  But it seems like they've been able to ride that out with some assistance from the pandemic.  

Amazon used to delight customers.  Now, customers just seem to tolerate them.  And most customers don't even know what you do, which is that most of the customer-aligned practices like returns or refunds are fully funded by the vendors and suppliers they strongarm, not by Amazon's generosity.

I too have used awareness of a company's bad practices as a thesis for holding the equity.  The bitterness of Apple's terrible policies and corrupt practices was moderated by knowing I could pay for the warranties they wouldn't honor by using stock gains.

I've said we'll go back to Amazon they day they end third party, but it doesn't seem like that's happening anytime soon.","Background: I am a 3rd party seller who sells private label goods on Amazon.

2024-03-07,ecommerce,"Just wondering why you're asking here and not the ad agency you're paying 20k/month. This seems like the thing they'd be most equipped to answer.

Also, Amazon has its own search algorithm and Amazon results rank highly in google shopping. If your agency is doing SEO work for you then it's probably contributing. 

Lastly, from my experience, certain customers are more comfortable with buying through Amazon instead of direct through a 3rd party store because Amazon will facilitate any disputes or chargebacks pretty much no questions asked.

I decided not to open an Amazon store for 2 reasons: Amazon is expensive, and having an Amazon store makes it so your Shopify store has to compete with it directly so you're competing with yourself. If the prices are the same, some customers will opt for the more trustworthy channel.","Hello, 

I run an ecommerce business in the sporting goods space. Our business/Shopify site has existed since 2019 - and we just launched on Amazon Jan 1 of 2024. 

We launched on Amazon just to see what would happen - and we did not anticipate the quick success that we have seen on that platform.

That being said this is where our confusion starts...

February 1st we started a contract with a new ads agency. Their goal was to drive sales to our Shopify site. While they were aware that we just started on Amazon - because it was so new our goal was just Shopify Sales. They set a projection at 50k for February on Shopify - which they hit. 

What we did not anticipate was that Amazon was going to do 25k in February. (In January Amazon did about 12k for us)

We are trying to determine the following...

1. Are the META ads responsible for the increase in Amazon sales?
2. How can we figure out what to attribute the Amazon sales to?
3. If amazon keeps growing and equals or overtakes our Shopify revenues - what strategies should we put in place to capitalize on that?

My thought as someone that does not know much about ads is that a customer is seeing an ad - visiting our site - then ultimately purchasing on Amazon. 

I do not like the fact that I do not know where these Amazon sales are coming from and I would appreciate any clarity. Thank you.

That being said this is where our confusion starts...

February 1st we started a contract with a new ads agency. Their goal was to drive sales to our Shopify site. While they were aware that we just started on Amazon - because it was so new our goal was just Shopify Sales. They set a projection at 50k for February on Shopify - which they hit. 

What we did not anticipate was that Amazon was going to do 25k in February. (In January Amazon did about 12k for us)

We are trying to determine the following...

1. Are the META ads responsible for the increase in Amazon sales?
2. How can we figure out what to attribute the Amazon sales to?
3. If amazon keeps growing and equals or overtakes our Shopify revenues - what strategies should we put in place to capitalize on that?

My thought as someone that does not know much about ads is that a customer is seeing an ad - visiting our site - then ultimately purchasing on Amazon. 

I do not like the fact that I do not know where these Amazon sales are coming from and I would appreciate any clarity. Thank you.

2024-03-08,ecommerce,"It's likely that your Meta ads are influencing Amazon sales. Consumers often research products they see in ads on other platforms, like Amazon, to read reviews or seek better deals. To understand this behavior, consider using unique promo codes or tracking URLs in your ads to gauge direct impact. Additionally, survey customers on Amazon about how they found your product. For future strategy, optimize your Amazon listing, consider Amazon ads, and perhaps run ads targeting Amazon directly. Balancing both platforms while understanding cross-channel influence will be key to maximizing your overall ecommerce strategy.","Hello,

2024-03-11,ecommerce,"Everybody quits Amazon after some time, the day nobody will want to sell there will arrive sooner or later.","Hi

So, my company more or less started by selling on Amazon about 11 years ago.  By 2016 I was doing about 50K in sales per month on Amazon. Started my own website in 2017. Sales on my own site have grown slowly but surely since then, so that I now do about 25K per month on my own site. Amazon meanwhile has more or less collapsed (about 5K per month now)

I'm at a point now where I'm just thinking of quitting Amazon. The business gives me a living without amazon now, so I'm no longer dependent on it. However, from a purely Financial perspective, amazon is still profitable for me. Reasons I'm thinking of quitting are

1. I have zero interest in it and it's emotionally draining. I'm sick of dealing with Seller support etc.. ever changing policies etc..
2. They deactivated our account last year for 3 months coming into Christmas. Our account was reopened in January, but we missed the busiest 3 months of the year, paid alot of storage in the time and it caused me huge amounts of stress - I was under huge pressure to pay suppliers etc.. but couldn't because Amazon were withholding funds. This was a point at which Amazon was affecting the rest of my business. I never found out why account was deactivated.
3. I don't really see a future with them. Sales have been sliding pretty consistently for about 5 years.
4. Low-inventory-level fee. As far as I understand, Amazon are going to start punishing sellers for low inventory. They also punish you for too much inventory already! I get the idea of punishing for too much inventory as they don't want sellers using them to just store bad products. But I think low inventory fees are really unfair, as often it's a supply chain issue preventing more stock.
5. Though it's still just profitable for me, I would rather reserve stock I currently sell on Amazon for my own website. Ads etc.. are more expensive than Amazon fees (for us it's 30% roughly through Google ads, compared to 15% on Amazon), but in the long run we will be more profitable selling on our own (we get a decent enough customer repeat rate - approx 40% repeat within 12 months)
6. The sales on there don't justify the hassle anymore. I sell on a couple of other marketplaces (e.g. Ebay and a local small one). They each do about 2-3K per month, BUT they're zero hassle at all. I don't mind selling on Marketplaces, but when they're a pain to deal with (like Amazon), it's taking away from my main focus. If we were doing 20K per month on Amazon, it may be worth dealing with the hassle.
7. I don't trust them. If our account ever gets deactivated again, or they introduce more problematic policies, I could be dealing with above issues once more.

We don't do FBA, but Amazon still makes arbitrary decisions on refunds that run counter to the refund/return policies THEY make us post.

I was a very early FBA user.  


Continual increase in fee's was a big one. The cost of sending boxes of inventory was cheap, but a return of products was expensive so that was kind of sketchy; but they want to be able to ""destroy"" the items which was a nice way of saying they want to resell them.  


On very competitive ASIN's, I would be selling hundreds of something per day, have a bunch left in stock and then all of a sudden sales would stop. Then my inventory would go from 200 to 110, and then I was being reimbursed for 5% of the sales price of the item; less than I was buying it for, and they would show up sale instantly by Amazon WarehouseDeals or whatever it was; so I would buy them, and they were completely fine but if I didn't catch it then I would simply lose all of that money.   


One day I had been selling and shipping in full force; sending in LTL's and full truckloads, just really fucking going hard on this. I call my accountant to review some of last quarters earnings and right there in a pie chart was how much Amazon was making and how much I wasn't making. I just couldn't shake that feeling; selling something and just making pennies at the end of the day.","Hi

I'm at a point now where I'm just thinking of quitting Amazon. The business gives me a living without amazon now, so I'm no longer dependent on it. However, from a purely Financial perspective, amazon is still profitable for me. Reasons I'm thinking of quitting are

1. I have zero interest in it and it's emotionally draining. I'm sick of dealing with Seller support etc.. ever changing policies etc..
2. They deactivated our account last year for 3 months coming into Christmas. Our account was reopened in January, but we missed the busiest 3 months of the year, paid alot of storage in the time and it caused me huge amounts of stress - I was under huge pressure to pay suppliers etc.. but couldn't because Amazon were withholding funds. This was a point at which Amazon was affecting the rest of my business. I never found out why account was deactivated.
3. I don't really see a future with them. Sales have been sliding pretty consistently for about 5 years.
4. Low-inventory-level fee. As far as I understand, Amazon are going to start punishing sellers for low inventory. They also punish you for too much inventory already! I get the idea of punishing for too much inventory as they don't want sellers using them to just store bad products. But I think low inventory fees are really unfair, as often it's a supply chain issue preventing more stock.
5. Though it's still just profitable for me, I would rather reserve stock I currently sell on Amazon for my own website. Ads etc.. are more expensive than Amazon fees (for us it's 30% roughly through Google ads, compared to 15% on Amazon), but in the long run we will be more profitable selling on our own (we get a decent enough customer repeat rate - approx 40% repeat within 12 months)
6. The sales on there don't justify the hassle anymore. I sell on a couple of other marketplaces (e.g. Ebay and a local small one). They each do about 2-3K per month, BUT they're zero hassle at all. I don't mind selling on Marketplaces, but when they're a pain to deal with (like Amazon), it's taking away from my main focus. If we were doing 20K per month on Amazon, it may be worth dealing with the hassle.
7. I don't trust them. If our account ever gets deactivated again, or they introduce more problematic policies, I could be dealing with above issues once more.

Anyone else quite Amazon after finding success with it previously? Were you glad you did?"
2024-03-11,smallbusiness,I think empire flippers is amazon fba focussed?,"Hey Everyone, I want to flip one of my Amazon listings. The listing currently has almost 1600 reviews with a rating of 4.7

I launched the product in 2021. The product struggled initially, however, I launched multiple variations and the product started generating a stable monthly profit of $900-1200. 

But I’m in a tricky situation right now, i am facing a cash-flow issue and unable to order more inventory some of my best selling variations are currently out of stock as a result the product is either breaking even or making a minimal loss over the past few months.

I want to know given the current status of the product can i sell the listing. I know profitability is important here, but i need to know whether i can flip the listing based on social presence?

Any help here would be really appreciated!"
2024-03-13,ecommerce,"I'm really confused how you can be on Walmart and Amazon but not think eBay is with the hassle? What is the hassle exactly? There's really affordable software to export your listings from any marketplace and import them to another. In 1 day you can have all of your products listed, and then you just need to sync your orders to the same place the Walmart and Amazon ones are going for fulfillment.","Hi All, I am a long-time Amazon reseller of licensed childrens clothing (Disney, Super Mario ect). 

We have watched our sales dip lower and lower on Amazon the last few years, I am wondering if Ebay is a good marketplace for these products.

We had tried Ebay years ago, and found it just wasn't worth the hassle. I believe we also had issues getting our full catalog online. 

Now that we are unfortunately hurting for sales, I am wondering if it is worth going through the hassle again. We are also on Walmart and see about 25% of the volume versus Amazon. "
2024-03-13,ecommerce,"In my experience the selling limits are pretty generous in terms of the number of items you can list. I don't think 6k SKUs would run into a problem. The only problem I run into with the selling limits is they cap the dollar amount you can have posted at 1 time. I had a $1million limit that was hard to stay under unless I kept my stock quantities very low, but thankfully they removed that last month so now I have no restrictions.


If you can get your listings exported and then imported into eBay nicely, I would say it's worth your time. eBay doesn't get as much traffic as Amazon or Walmart, but their fees are much lower and they have fewer restrictions so it is one of my personal favorite marketplaces.","Hi All, I am a long-time Amazon reseller of licensed childrens clothing (Disney, Super Mario ect).

2024-03-14,ecommerce,">Also Ebay only allowed X amount of listings live at one time, so that was another issue.
>
> We have 6k SKU's. 

We have over 50,000 SKU's and eBay doesn't even blink. As long as you have been assigned appropriate limits to your account (e.g. number and dollar value of items listed) it should work for you.

As a new seller you would need to work up slowly as they expand your limits over time. You may be able to get CS to raise a request for an early increase if you can point to a good history and similar # of SKU's on Amazon.

BTW be aware that they count dollar value not just by the selling price of each BIN listing but also the quantity you advise as available. So if you tell them you have 100 of a $10 item they will count it as $1000 against your selling limit. For new sellers it can be useful to tell eBay a lower inventory count than you might actually have on your shelf so as to reduce that total as it cuts into your ability to list other SKU's.

We sell on both Amazon and eBay (and formerly on Walmart, but that was such a bad experience we turned it off) and while eBay sales are lower they are *way* less of a headache to deal with than Amazon.","Hi All, I am a long-time Amazon reseller of licensed childrens clothing (Disney, Super Mario ect).

2024-03-17,FulfillmentByAmazon,"This is after a certain threshold and it makes sense. Poorly executed, because Amazon leadership is just trash, but it does make sense.  Their return expense is ballooning, but there are two main culprits, not the whole 3P seller system. The first is the pretty much unchecked ability for Chinese sellers to open and supply FBA accounts with low quality trash, only to be eventually suspended And reopen accounts a week later. Another major issue is the indiscriminate returns by crybaby prime customers. I'm a prime customer too and it's way too easy to return something.  This is a huge selling point for the prime service but they should selectively target non profitable return abusers (they already are,  just not nearly aggressively enough ). 
What the trash leadership doesn't get is that combining unreasonable disposal and return fees, along with higher fulfillment fees, will pretty much eliminate any low margin product in the platform. Great thing to do when everyone is flush with cash. Dumb thing to do when temu is right up your ass in sales revenue. And as usual,  they'll change their approach once it bites them in the ass, but it will be too late by then.

I'm only half joking, really. People can be real shitty. I deal with probably 10-20 people every single week that are unreasonable, uncivilized, and downright nasty.

What policy should I take in dealing with these guys? I like to see them give me $3,000 in an order on my website, but that's bitter-sweet as it seems they'll just siphon sales from my Amazon listing. My website does about 150 sales/day and our Amazon listing does about 200 sales/day.

Is this reselling activity even beneficial for my business? I'm considering disallowing all of this. What's the best policy to take here? Is it possible to shut down my buy box for 3rd party resellers?"
2024-03-24,ecommerce,Depends on what you sell but Walmart and Target Plus are the two to look at after Amazon and eBay I would say.,"I’ve had ok experiences with eBay and Etsy, but neither are anywhere close to Amazon.  I’m wondering if anyone can share their experiences with some of the other online marketplace out there such as Facebook, Walmart, TikTok and any other marketplaces that are available in the USA.  

If you don’t do well on any of these other marketplaces, what about Shopify?  Do you do better just advertising your own website on Facebook and Google?

I’m personally trying to diversify as much as possible from Amazon since they like to kick everyone in the teeth.  If anyone has any advice it’s appreciated.  I’m having trouble replacing even 10% of the sales I get from Amazon.  

Thanks for any help.

2024-03-24,ecommerce,"If you are a Walmart Marketplace seller, you need to have certain degree of control over your shipping carrier. Walmart counts orders as a valid shipment after the ""origin scan"" (when the package starting moving within the carrier's network). This means if Fedex picks up a truck worth of orders today and forget to put in an origin scan until tomorrow, you will take a hit on your VTR (valid tracking rate), which is a KPI you do not want to mess up. This is especially problematic since even if you do ""ship"" on or before the required ship date, you will only meet the on time shipment metric, not the VTR metric. When USPS gets busy, they will cause a lot of VTR problem by no having that origin scan.

I believe this is done to heavily incentivize using Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS, their version of FBA). What Walmart and WFS are doing though, is targeting all the pain points of FBA in an attempt to steal business and grow: reduced or no surge pricing for storage, lower fulfillment fees, better rates for sellers buying shipping through Walmart, etc.

For listings, when Walmart finds your listing uncompetitive they will unpublish your listing or let the best seller for that SKU (Walmart determines whether multiple SKU are identical products across sellers) take over entirely. Walmart doesn't seem to want 200 different variations of the same product polluting the search results, so they are doing some product curation.

When I still sold on Walmart last year, it was much easier and cheaper to get front page ranking, like 5-10x less spend on ads vs Amazon. However, the volume just doesn't compare.

As far as the customer base, it's surprisingly not bad. Returns and claims are in line with other marketplaces.","I’ve had ok experiences with eBay and Etsy, but neither are anywhere close to Amazon.

2024-03-27,stocks,I know this is coming way from left field but it’s good to see Amazon is willing to open the pocket book. I say this as a shareholder and fan of Rivian who may need some capital injected to reach its full potential. Given that Amazon already has 10K delivery vans from Rivian it wouldn’t be good form them to have to maintenance them with other support of a health OEM.,"Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race. 

The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that’s widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.

The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday’s news marks Amazon’s second tranche of that funding.

Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source. 

Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.

News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.

“Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.

Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.

The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.

Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.

It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia. 

Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.

Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.

Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.

But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.

Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images; instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.

“Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”

Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership. 

These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.

AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year. 

“There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”

Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.

FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”

2024-03-28,FulfillmentByAmazon,"I started on VC and switched around 100k in sales. Ended with around 10MM FBA route by the time I sold. 

Amazon won't say this outright but all the talent got moved from VC to SC a long time ago. That's why there's little new feature set on VC and all the exclusives from before (Vine, promos, ads) are now cross platform.

There's pretty much zero reason to use VC, but you realize this. If you are able, just list against all your VC listings via FBA and transition out that way. Most FBA guys will just assume it's possible, but if you have really antiquated ASINs, they can be really messed up in the catalog and require a butt load of work. Or your inventory immediately gets pulled with an IP violation and you can't prove ownership of the brand even though you are BR owner. 

I helped one company switch and to be perfectly honest only 70% of ASINs successfully made the jump. Super frustrating because they did all the right things with having BR, an AM and contribute rights but there is still some crazy ass privilege that some 1P/VC listings have that screw up the ability for the BR to contribute updates.

Just be persistent with SS and escalate issues straight to the catalog team if you can. Better luck with phone vs email. We used a bunch of tricks that no longer work now but hopefully the gremlins we ran into are fixed for you.

Like I said, sounds like it should be incredibly straight forward, and for most of your ASINs it will, but cross your fingers on the rest. Good luck.","Does anyone have a 7 figure+ Amazon business where you were on VC and transitioned to Seller Central (FBA) that would be willing to talk with me. I am almost ready to launch our transition plan with my company but would like to talk with a similar company that has gone through this recently.

Thank you in advanced. "

2024-03-27,FulfillmentByAmazon,"I went through this - the downsides of VC started to increasingly grow frustrating.  Amazon's inflexibility in the face of inflationary pressure made what is supposed to feel like a great experience (i.e. commerce on a large scale) feel foreboding and filled with anxiety.  

Here's how we approached it - we co-listed all the ASINs on FBA and focused on multi-packs as a key differentiator (adding volume discounts) to help build our sales ranking while sending in inventory and slowing down our VC refills.  We didn't have much of a track record with the VC side (as we went from FBA to VC and then back).

One thing which was extremely frustrating was the fact that all the VC ASINs are locked behind catalog edits guarded by Amazon's Catalog team.  Getting edits or updates on even the smallest details takes a lot of time, patience, and can be frustrating. Thankfully, I didn't onboard my entire portfolio.

Amazon is greedy AF so get ready for a lot of frustrating BS.  We have since also co-listed as FBM alongside FBA and so far it's working.","Does anyone have a 7 figure+ Amazon business where you were on VC and transitioned to Seller Central (FBA) that would be willing to talk with me.

Leaked document shows Amazon expects to save $1.3 billion by slashing office vacancies and terminating leases early

Amazon aims to save $1.3 billion by reducing office vacancies over the next three to five years.

Natural lease expirations and early lease terminations are part of the plan.
           
This is part of a larger cost-cutting strategy that includes shuttered projects and layoffs.
Amazon (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hr-document-employees-pip-layoffs-performance-improvement-plans-2024-3) expects to save roughly $1.3 billion in coming years by radically reducing office vacancies (https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-outlook-office-buildings-vacancies-commerical-markets-investors-remote-2024-1), according to a person familiar with the matter and an internal document obtained by Business Insider.
To get there, Amazon is letting certain leases naturally expire, stopping the use of some office floors, and negotiating early lease terminations for some buildings, the person said. They asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

Currently, Amazon has an office vacancy rate of 33.8%, this person said. That number is expected to drop to 25% in 2024 and go down to 10% over the next three to five years. The change will result in approximately $1.3 billion in annual operating expense savings, according to the internal document.
The company's office vacancy rate of almost 34% is the result of slower growth and layoffs, the person familiar told BI.

Getting this down to about 10% in coming years will be another blow to the commercial real estate (https://www.businessinsider.com/commercial-real-estate-big-trouble-crash-bank-crisis-2024-2) market, which is already reeling from the remote work boom, overbuilding, and retrenchment by big companies such as Google and Meta.

Rating agency Fitch recently warned that the plunge in US office values (https://www.businessinsider.com/office-commercial-real-estate-cre-crash-2008-gfc-delinquency-vacancy-2024-3) could match or exceed 2008's real estate collapse, as prices have yet to bottom out.
Amazon's office retrenchment is part of a broader, on-going cost-cutting strategy, which includes shuttered projects (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs-10000-employees-grand-challenge-team-dramatic-changes-2022-11), scaled back expansion plans (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-sublet-up-to-30-million-square-feet-warehouse-space-2022-5), and the largest layoffs in company history (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-layoffs).

In an email to BI, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said it's normal business practice to review the company's real estate portfolio.

""We're constantly evaluating our real estate portfolio based on the dynamic and diverse needs of Amazon's businesses by looking at trends in how employees are using our offices,"" Glasser said in a statement. ""The changes we've already made are improving vacancy rates, and we expect to see further progress as we continue to learn and iterate on our portfolio.""

Hubs and hibernations
Amazon is also trying to increase office density by mandating that employees relocate to central ""hubs,"" as BI previously reported (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-voluntary-resignation-employees-relocate-rto-2023-7). Moving more employees to the same locations theoretically means the company can use less office space in non-""hub"" locations.

Obviously, if more employees work in the office, a company's office vacancy rate should fall.

The person familiar with the matter also noted that so-called hibernations can help reduce office costs for Amazon. This involves moves such as stopping the use of an entire floor or building to minimize operational expenses like HVAC and lighting. These locations would remain in Amazon's office portfolio during hibernation, the person added.

RTO policy
Amazon's Glasser stressed that plans for efficient use of office space are not related to the company's RTO policy.

""To suggest that this is about anything else — such as our expectations for working in the office — is at best a misunderstanding and at worst intentionally misleading,"" he told BI.

Internally, Amazon is aware of how last year's return-to-office policy caused confusion and frustration among some employees, people familiar with the plans told BI. The rushed announcement and outdated data have led to some buildings being unready (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rto-mandate-shows-some-offices-not-ready-until-september-2023-4) and delays in bringing back people to their offices, these people said.

On top of that, most of the office space planning is still done manually, using spreadsheets, instead of more sophisticated software tools, one of the people said, which is further complicating the process.

Amazon continues to trim costs in other areas. The latest layoffs took place on Tuesday, when the advertising team cut up to 160 jobs,
as BI previously reported (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-advertising-hit-with-another-round-layoffs-2024-3)
. The Alexa team, meanwhile, is
overhauling its backend system (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-secret-war-on-android-alexa-2024-3) to further reduce operational costs. One Medical, the healthcare company Amazon acquired for $3.9 billion, has been
under pressure to save more (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-one-medical-project-espresso-reset-amazon-healthcare-bet-2024-2).

Amazon staff have been unsuccessfully protesting the RTO mandate since last year. More than 30,000 employees signed an internal petition (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-return-to-office-policy-petition-30000-staff-remote-work-2023-3), arguing that most of them were hired as fully remote workers during the pandemic. But Amazon's leadership rejected the petition (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hr-chief-rejects-petition-against-return-to-office-policy-2023-3), and CEO Andy Jassy later warned employees that ""it's probably not going to work out for you at Amazon"" if they continued to refuse to comply.",No content (link post)

Amazon is just doing their usual tricks to look good to their investors.,"Amazon’s cloud computing division is laying off hundreds of employees in its physical stores technology and sales and marketing units, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

“We’ve identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact,” an AWS spokesperson said in a statement. “We didn’t make these decisions lightly, and we’re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition to new roles in and outside of Amazon.”

The cuts were first reported by GeekWire.

Amazon’s lucrative AWS unit has seen its sales growth decelerate in recent quarters as companies trimmed their cloud spend amid rising interest rates. Amazon executives expressed some optimism in February when they said the market is starting to show signs of a reacceleration.

The cuts to AWS’ store technology team come after Amazon said it would remove cashierless checkout systems in its U.S. Fresh stores. The AWS unit includes teams overseeing the cashierless tech, called Just Walk Out, as well as its Dash smart carts and Amazon One palm-based payment technology. The store technology team was moved out of Amazon’s retail group and folded into its cloud computing division in 2022.

The AWS spokesperson said the company decided to make cuts to the store technology division “as a result of a broader strategic shift in the use of some applications in Amazon’s owned as well as in third-party stores.”

Amazon continues to trim its headcount after more than a year of mass layoffs. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across almost every area of the company. So far this year, Amazon has laid off employees in its Twitch, Audible, Buy with Prime, and Prime Video and MGM Studios units.

Employees in the U.S. will continue to receive their pay and benefits for at least 60 days, and they will be eligible for a severance package.

Ok, well, Amazon hired over 400,000 employees during a 9 month period of 2020 alone.  \~33% of its workforce at the time.  These numbers do not include employee churn, nor do they include temporary holiday workers.  NOR do they include delivery drivers, who are contractors and not direct Amazon employees.  Their workforce right now is still 400,000 people MORE than it was in 2021.

With certainty they did not do this with the belief that those were all permanent positions.  And more of them were engineering and software than some of you are probably thinking right now.

2024-04-11,FulfillmentByAmazon,I think alot of successful Amazon sellers won't really tell their story.  I think the most successful Amazon sellers came from a reseller background  whether wholesale or Ebay and leverage that knowledge.,"Hi! I’ve been an Amazon seller for 5 years launching 1-2 products a year.  I’ve had some success with a few products but then certain things happen: 
market becomes to saturated, esp with Chinese sellers that sell half the price, ppc gets suspended for several months, I sell out and am out of stock for 4 weeks which drops my rankings and sales and was never able to get it back.  I’ve joined a mentorship course, I have all the Amazon tools (Helium 10, jungle scout).  I never make profit, ppc or Amazon feed take up all my profit and I’ve significantly cut back on PPC.  
What has been the key to your guys’ success? Building a true brand and promoting on social media? "
2024-04-11,FulfillmentByAmazon,"For me what worked was building very unique brands, been on Amazon since 2011, Did reselling on eBay since 98. so had experience in copywriting and found some niches that were undeveloped or had big companies pull out from because they weren’t big enough for them but for a small operation it’s more than enough. 

I think without a huge budget it would very hard to do the “me too” products now, basically private labeling the same thing as others and be very successful. We definitely have that but they are more complimentary products and our 80/20 is made up of original designs, patented products and unique offerings that still no one has copied. We have a seasonal best seller that makes around $250K every summer been selling it since 2016 and yet we are still the only one like it and it wouldn’t be terribly difficult to copy. The main reason why nobody has probably copied it? We manufacture it ourselves, it doesn’t come from China and no factory makes anything remotely close is my guess. 

Building very high quality and becoming obsessive about it to your audience will make it last and give you repeat customers for life.  On Amazon we are doing mid seven figures, but you need to know your numbers and not invest your capital into products that don’t give you the best ROI unless they compliment your product line but for main product you need to dial that in. Amazon fees are just increasing, just in the last 5 years it has gone from 26% to 38% of our gross sales. 

Find something you can build an audience around, with unique features and market the shit out of that off of Amazon. That’s what others are too lazy to do and those that do are more successful.

2024-04-11,stocks,"As a shareholder, I am deeply concerned that Mr. Jassy is producing a short term gain at the expense of a longterm one. By destroying morale, burning out employees and making it impossible for new ideas to flourish I believe he is doing a disservice to employees, customers and shareholders alike. It is known that acting Jack Welch or Chainsaw Al is bad for business - just look at the fall of GE. I have several close friends who work at Amazon that are high performers and already burnt out… the average tenure of employees is dropping. Business units like AWS have insane employee turnover.

I want to see longterm strategy and vision return to Amazon… costcutting like this smacks of, “I have tried nothing and I am all out ideas.” At this rate, I think Bezos will have to return temporarily to right the ship and find a new successor.

Prime is no longer worth it with the increased fee and remove services and now ads in our tv shows… that’s not the deal we signed up for.

On the other hand, Amazon is so big that likely the stock will grow some regardless of what the CEO does.","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to keep looking for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.

“I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing,” Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in 2021.

Under Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.

Even amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said he’s focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains “resilient.” He stressed the importance of building “primitive services,” which he described as “discrete, foundational building blocks” that can spur new projects and businesses.

Jassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazon’s CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazon’s most profitable businesses.

He said he believes generative artificial intelligence stands to be Amazon’s next “primitive service” that could transform the company. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,” Jassy wrote.

Amazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will replace Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.

In the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazon’s businesses.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmazonSeller) if you have any questions or concerns.*",Is it just me or with everyone else Amazon takes away 50 % off each sale from me including all the fees and taxes of course then in the left out 50% i have to take out all my cost and profit is it with everyone please let me know 
2024-04-13,AmazonSeller,"I think there are several ways to address your question, but I will do so from my own early experiences selling on FBA.  First of all you have to accept the fact that the Amazon platform is a for-profit business.  On top of this, they have no competition for the FBA platform thus far and they set the rules, own the field, the refs, the ball, and the league.  If you don't like it, go play somewhere else.  Sucks, but if you think Amazon owes you something just because you have products to sell, it is the incorrect approach.  

The platform is ""buyer-centric"" not ""seller centric"".  They have a monster captive audience of buyers which is why as a seller, you want to access those buyers.   Besides this, Amazon themselves are the actual sellers on many products and are selling more products themselves every day.  It is hard to compete with them.

The obvious sign that it is harder to be a seller is that i they really wanted to grow their seller base, then Seller Support would not be as horrible as it is today.  Progressively it has gotten worse over the years.  There is a reason for this.

So then, to address your question, you need to be super smart about what you sell.  Think small and valuable, like a diamond.  The smaller the item and higher the price, the less in fulfillment fees and storage fees you will get charged.  Whereas larger, bulky, heavy items will crush you in fees.  

Even then I sometimes looked at a 25% -33% rule of thumb where if I paid $10 for something and could send a pallet with say 400 items, then I was happy getting $12.50 back after all fees.  So a 25% return.  Usually these items would sell for $25 to $30.  My thinking at the time was I could move 400 items in one shot, never see them again and not deal with making 400 little packages every time something sold.  

FBA is something great if you can find the right mix of product and profit.  But it can also be frustrating.  If you find yourself not making enough and complaining about it, then you need to rethink your strategy.

Hope this helps.,",Is it just me or with everyone else Amazon takes away 50 % off each sale from me including all the fees and taxes of course then in the left out 50% i have to take out all my cost and profit is it with everyone please let me know 
2024-04-14,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Does Nawprotect really work? Is their tactic Amazon TOS complaint? I’m genuinely curious for future reference. 

Sign up for Transparency. Haven’t had any hijackers on our PL listings ever since.","Hi Sellers, Super frustrated at the moment. Anyone ever had a successful private label listing just get continually hijacked over and over again by different black hat sellers/scammers?

Sales and reviews on one of my private label asins are really good, 30k+ p/m when not getting hijacked but currently still 15k p/m even though I'm losing the buy box every few days and these guys are tanking my reviews messing up the algorithm.

What did you do to overcome this?
We are already brand registered, trademark is pending so transparency or project zero aren't options just yet.

Our product is fully branded, from the item itself to the carry cases to the custom manuals and packaging and would be hard to replicate but scammers dgaf.

We use Nawprotect atleast once or twice a week but it's getting expensive. I feel like I can't win. It takes a week to get rid of the hijacker, but by the time that happens 1-2 new ones pop up in that time.

It just seems so ludicrous to me that once you start to experience success and profitability that scammers will just ruin it for you, steal your sales and destroy your hard work. 

Did you guys just change products, pull the pin on Amazon altogether or persevere through the hijackings until your trademark was fully registered and then get access to the full arsenal of brand registry benefits and pray the hijackers don't destroy your listing or that you don't lose too much money during that time?

Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? 😅"

I was stowing next to this guys girlfriend last night and we were discussing video games.

He continually insists that she moves down and that he would cherry pick smalls for her. She finally obliged and they move, he lets her walk in front of him to create distance and he turns to me and says “You ever talk to her again we will have problems” 😂

2024-05-10,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Most the top selling groceries ( outside of the ones listed by the brands or Amazon direct  ) are all breaking the bundling , Variety pack , bulk rules . 

It’s a gamble you could get taken down tomorrow or maybe not for 5 years .

We do 20+ million in groceries on Amazon annually . Just got off an unjust week long suspension for bundling ( our SAS rep suggested we add a few things to our titles . That caused the trigger to a more in-depth review ) .

So we spoke and hired several lawyers and firms to get the suspension off and they all said the past few weeks they’ve been getting dozens and dozens of big grocery / candy sellers past couple weeks calling for help .

Read amazons rules for variety packs , bundling , bulk and don’t do anything in the grey area","So I've been doing Amazon for a couple of years now here and there nothing fancy, but enough to pretty much get auto-approved for anything I apply to sell in. In most cases, whatever I intend to sell is already listed on Amazon so I just piggy-back off that listing and undercut the competitor.

What confuses me is that I can piggyback off an existing listing but if I wanted to sell a new grocery item that isn't listed on Amazon then I need permission from the brand owner? So why is it that much easier to list off an existing item but close to impossible to list a brand new product?

Lastly, I noticed that some sellers have listed a brand product under their own company ""brand name"" and with a GTIN/UPC that they've purchased and branded it with themselves. How would I go abouts doing that? Because from my understanding I would need to supply Amazon with a letter from the brand owner allowing me to sell his product and I don't think this seller(s) ever had any permission based on the info I've seen published in the listing.

Just for reference, I found a new grocery product (chips) that is not available on Amazon, UPC isn't even recognized on Amazon. What would be my best option to get this item listed?

1. Attempt to sell this item as a bundle under ""Generic"" brand with a GTIN exemption?
2. Attemp to sell this item as a bundle under my brand name with a GTIN exemption?
3. Apply to get this brand approved and hope they don't ask for a letter from the brand owner?

2024-05-13,dividends,"Maybe I'm oversimplifying, but isn't it normal for companies to have high highs and low lows? Like normal companies, not Truth Social. Google, Amazon, Wal Mart, etc. Would one not expect to see good years and bad years?","We've all heard, ""Buy the dip!"" , but let's be honest, watching your favorite companies' stocks plummet can be a gut-wrenching experience. Even titans like Google ($GOOG) and Amazon ($AMZN) aren't invincible.

**Remember the Great Tech Tumble of 2020 and 2022?**  $GOOG took a nosedive, and $AMZN wasn't far behind. Those were rough seas to navigate, even for seasoned investors.

A similar story is happening with BTI and SBUX right now. (HSY is recovering) 

Individual stocks can be a wild ride, filled with exhilarating highs and potentially soul-crushing lows. While conducting thorough research is crucial, it's equally important to be prepared for the emotional rollercoaster that comes with the territory.

Here's the thing: while picking individual stocks offers the potential for amplified returns, it also comes with amplified risks. Unlike a diversified portfolio that spreads your bets across various sectors and asset classes, a single stock can be heavily influenced by company-specific news or industry shifts. Imagine pouring your heart (and wallet) into a company you believe in, only to see it embroiled in a PR nightmare or disrupted by a technological leapfrog from a competitor.

**So, what's an aspiring investor to do?**

* **Diversification is your friend:** Consider spreading your investments across a variety of sectors and asset classes. This can help mitigate the risk of any one stock taking a major tumble.  (Obviously there are index funds and an average speculator should never venture into individual stocks) 
* **Know your risk tolerance:** Be honest with yourself about how much volatility you can stomach. If the thought of seeing your portfolio value swing wildly keeps you up at night, individual stocks might not be the best fit. (None of my core holdings are more than 5%) 
* **Do your research, but don't get caught up in the hype:** While social media can be entertaining, they shouldn't be the sole basis for your investment decisions. Deep dive into financial statements, company news, and industry trends before placing your bets. 
* **Develop an investment plan and stick to it:** Don't let emotions cloud your judgement. Having a clear investment strategy that outlines your goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline can help you stay disciplined during market fluctuations.

Remember, successful investing is a marathon, not a sprint. By prioritizing long-term growth over short-term gains and keeping a cool head during periods of volatility, you'll be well on your way to navigating the stock market with confidence.

All this is common sense... But are you able to hold on to a stock for 5-10-20 years if the stock market was closed ? If the answer is no... sell and invest in index funds instead..

My portfolio has swinged -20% on bad days and I have held on to my stocks because of due diligence and since they are fundamentally strong businesses that will be around for decades. "

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2024-05-17,FulfillmentByAmazon,"As someone who has never paid Amazon a penny in advertising, this makes me cringe.

All of you people willing to pay Amazon is what made Amazon such a shitty place for sellers. My legit OEM products are now in the 12th spot and all this chinese bullshit is in spots 1-11 because they are sponsored. 

Amazon makes a shit ton of money, however the customer gets a super shitty experience by getting tricked by keywords into buying some garbage product.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2024-05-23,AmazonSeller,"Personally, I'd ignore the law suit. The Chinese seller isn't going to really care about a USA lawsuit, and Amazon aren't likely to care. It will be a waste of time and money.

I'm assuming it is FBA, so you can easily order, and return for full refund. Do this, claim it is fake in the return process. There is a chance that just saying the word 'fake' in the return process will give them a violation in the account. Amazon is run by bots....

Either way, yeah, if they ever come back on, make the order, return/ refund, claim copyright.

Up until a couple of years ago, it was nice and convenient for me, a WFH individual (since 2002) who doesn’t drive to get a return in .  Simply just let them know, they’d schedule a pick up, or I could print my own label and have it dropped off.  No fees whatsoever 

A couple of years ago, they changed this ..  They started charging $8 for SOME pickups, but not all, and labels were still feee.  Even UPS store drop offs, free.  Still convenient.  I just printed the label and had DoorDash drop them off

Somewhere in the last couple of months (my last DD pickup was March 20), they started charging us to print the labels at home now.  Same amount as UPS pick ups

Even though I haven't done this myself, I'd suggest you grow the FBA business and sell it whilst its at peak (dont hesitate as competitors are constantly entering the market and soon they'll steal your market share). Then use your new found wealth to invest in other things,","
I am M(32) moved to France to work as an engineer.I always knew , work won’t bring me the indépendance of location and speech and so,
I parallely started studying the Amazon business model (FBA) , and very soon invested all what I saved(13k euros) into a product and selling it in UK, only to be able to make 335k of net revenue of 90k in profits in about 8 months , expanding from one product line to 21 different products in (gaps in the market in the same niche) both in UK , Germany and USA.
Along With that I co-founded 2 other companies with 2 more products in two other(kitchen and bathroom cleaning) niches and now having 3 product lines in USA only in the 8 months period mark .


Now , If I achieve whatever I wrote at the start of the year , I would be able to leave my engineering job very soon .

Now all I can think of is expansion and networking with great product finders that have the hunger to invest their time with “my money to invest” with a stake in the company and jointly run the E-commerce brand. 

I never want to retire .I just want to retire from the work and as for my business and growing my e commerce brand , I would continue on this until I no more can.

If I can resume what I did 
1. Looked for what everyone needs in mass.

2. Making improvements that people need without changing how the consumer interact with the product(no drastic changes).

3. Validated the idea with a test inventory

4.Built a money making asset.

5. If you enroll in Career Choice or already have one, use that student email for YouTube Premium, Spotify Premium, Hulu, and Amazon Prime discounts they cut the subscription price by almost half 

6. For my Android users don't pay a dime for Spotify or YouTube Premium, look into ReVanced or XManager 

7. Screw going for PA or into Operations in general, you'll be overwork, underappreciated, and shit on by everyone over and under you.

2024-05-31,ecommerce,"I haven't had anything like this happen to me, but my spider-senses tell me it's a scam. If you're EVER in doubt, hang up, and get in touch with the support team they are claiming to be (in this example, contact Amazon). If they don't know what the person who called was talking about, you can bet it's a scam.","I recently created my Seller account a few days ago and have reached out to Seller Support for some questions, but only through the platform's messaging system, without the option for a phone call from Amazon Support. Today, I received a call from someone claiming to be from Amazon Seller Support, asking if I was having difficulty creating a listing (I had not raised this issue with Amazon Support before). I simply responded that I do not need that kind of support at the moment.

My question is, was that person really from Amazon Support, or am I experiencing a scam? They said they would send me an email so I can ask for support if needed, which sounds very strange to me. Has anyone else experienced something similar? I am from France, if that matters. The person who spoke to me did not sound like a native French speaker."

2024-06-01,smallbusiness,"I sell toys. Amazon does make it tough on lots of products, but people want to be in our space supporting local. Do you offer giftwrap or any other services? Or some kind of bundle discount perhaps or rewards program? How is your customer service and product knowledge? How is the vibe and decor in your store?

You could also think about dropping the price a bit and seeing if it helps. You don't need to meet amazon's price, just try some kind of sale. People literally love sales. Yes you are not making as much profit but if you aren't in a MAP agreement with the vendor you can change prices asyou see fit.   Sometomes moving volume now is better than waiting for max profit later.

Many people who come into a small shop understand they will be paying more than amazon and they will do so if you give them good reason.

Also, a lot of people who walk into a small business don't buy anything regardless.

Your other option is stop carrying the brand. Sometimes its just not worth it to deal with amazon undercutters.","I have a clothing & perfume physical store.

2024-06-24,ecommerce,We’re a jump rope brand doing ROAS of around 5 on Google ads. Currently our stock is at our own warehouse and we do shipping ourselves. But if I look at Amazon FBA their shipping seems to be about half the costs of our shipping due to local warehousing. Doing Amazon FBA is not a problem for us as we have enough inventory. Also if Amazon FBA works well we’re ok with moving completely to Amazon FBA with multichannel fulfilment as it would save costs in the end and shipping would be quicker. ,"We're a EU brand selling our products through our own ecom website and we're looking at breaking into Amazon.

2024-06-24,ecommerce,"Which country are you based in and where do you want to sell?

In general, selling on Amazon (compared to your own store)

PROS:

* Much higher traffic
* Cheaper shipping rates if you choose FBA
* You can easily integrate FBA into your eCom (at least Shopify, Woo etc.) so you will benefit on your current shop.

CONS:

* Ad-spend can be high if it is a competitive category
* Higher possibilities of scams or dishonest buyers. Amazon will favor buyers most of the time.
* No compensation for returned inventory damaged by customer
* Might have VAT/Sales tax implications based on your legal structure and location

So what exactly do you want to know? What did you mean by €1000 service costs? Who is quoting this for you? Selling on Amazon is free or you pay 40 EUR a month professional seller fee.

Other than that there are no fixed fees for registration.","We're a EU brand selling our products through our own ecom website and we're looking at breaking into Amazon. However the niche seems to be saturated and competitive. We're looking if it's worth the investment to break into Amazon.

2024-06-24,ecommerce,We are located within the EU and want to sell to all countries within the EU. If we want to do FBA with local warehousing which will generate the most sales (my expectation due to prime) we need to have VAT numbers of the countries where we store our inventory. That would be 7 countries and is €150 per country through Amazon. Besides that there is a monthly VAT service but since we’re already selling in Europe I don’t think this is needed although I can’t find any information about this.  The goal is obviously to be probitable on Amazon and I think the reach will be broader than our current target audience making volumes higher as well. ,"We're a EU brand selling our products through our own ecom website and we're looking at breaking into Amazon.

2024-06-24,ecommerce,"Ah I see. I would suggest you start with storing inventory in one EU country (for example Germany). It would make you qualify for Amazon buy box in all EU marketplaces. But you will pay more to ship outside Germany (let us say to Spain).

In this stage you need to these VAT filings:

1. Your local quarterly/monthly VAT filing (It looks like you are Dutch, so in this case NL VAT filings)
2. Your Germany VAT filings monthly/quarterly depending on volumes. You can get Amazon service for this or get another third party. We use an external service which is somewhat expensive, but a lot more reliable. You can also do this yourself if you understand enough German.
3. Your OSS VAT filings. You file this on NL Belastingdienst but as a separate filing. All your sales from NL/DE to other EU countries need to go there. You can do this yourself or hire someone.

In any case, you should be doing 1 and 3 already. So only the second step is additional. You have to do this when you store inventory in another EU country independent of whether you are selling on Amazon or not.

Then you can expand to other countries if you see the market is big enough and if the shipping costs are high.

I can not judge if these costs and admin overheads are affordable for your business. It really depends on your scale, margins and your business appetite.","We're a EU brand selling our products through our own ecom website and we're looking at breaking into Amazon.

2024-06-26,stocks,Amazon just breached its previous all time high from back in 2021.  Chart is very bullish.  With forward earnings of around 40 its value is very favourable compared to historical.  This will keep going up.,"Amazon.com Inc. has reached a $2 trillion market valuation for the first time ever as an artificial intelligence-fueled rally pushed the tech giant deeper into record territory. 

Shares rose as much as 3.6% Wednesday to $193.04, pushing the market value to more than $2 trillion. The company is now a member of an elite club of a handful of peers that have surpassed the key market capitalization. Alphabet Inc. passed the $2 trillion threshold in late April, while rallies have pushed market values of Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. to more than $3 trillion. 

Amazon shares have whipsawed since the company’s first quarter earnings, when the cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, helping to power the stock back above the all-time high set in April. The stock rallied in June, recovering losses from the end of May to gain about 27% so far this year.

Shares of the megacap technology company have gotten a lift over the past year as the company cut costs and restructured its business to better take advantage of the AI frenzy. In addition, its key Amazon Web Services business has shown signs of re-accelerating growth, a major point of optimism for investors. "
2024-06-27,stocks,Odd when Amazon is already flooded with Chinese flea market quality merchandise.,"Amazon plans to launch a new section on its site dedicated to low-priced fashion and lifestyle items that will allow Chinese sellers to ship directly to U.S. consumers, CNBC has learned.

The storefront, announced at an invite-only conference for Chinese sellers on Wednesday, would mark Amazon’s most aggressive attempt yet to fend off growing competition from e-commerce upstarts Temu and Shein, which both have ties to China, the world’s second-largest economy.

Temu and Shein have expanded their presence in the U.S. in recent years, luring an increasing share of American shoppers with their rock-bottom prices on clothing, electronics, home goods and other products.

Amazon’s storefront will feature a range of unbranded items, many priced under $20, according to a presentation to Amazon sellers viewed by CNBC. A mock-up of the storefront showed a gua sha facial massaging tool, arm weights and phone cases, among other items for sale.

Amazon will ship the products directly from China to the U.S., with the goal of delivering them to shoppers within nine to 11 days, the presentation shows. In the past, Amazon sellers in China have relied on the company’s fulfillment services, called Fulfillment by Amazon, to send goods to warehouses in the U.S. before they are dispatched to customers.

The company pitched the arrangement as cost savings for Amazon sellers in China, and said merchants would be able to test new items through small-batch production. Shein uses a similar model, referred to as on-demand manufacturing, producing a limited quantity of goods and manufacturing more as demand increases.

In a statement to CNBC, Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said, “We are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices, and greater convenience.”

Boschetti declined to comment further on the company’s plans, which were first reported by The Information. It is unclear when Amazon intends to debut the storefront, but the presentation notes it will start accepting products this fall.

China-based merchants have made up a sizable contingent of Amazon’s marketplace for many years, but the company is making a renewed push to court sellers there as it faces growing competition. In December, Amazon announced a new “innovation center” in Shenzhen, a popular technology and manufacturing hub, and it also slashed the fees it charges merchants selling clothing priced below $20.

Amazon said in 2023 the number of items sold by Chinese sellers on its site grew more than 20% year over year, while the number of Chinese merchants with sales upward of $10 million increased 30%.

It’s a real shame. Our product was costing us around $3 to buy and deliver to Amazon. We were selling them at around $12. Roughly $6 in Amazon fees.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

From Amazon, at least monthly I'm feuding about some way Amazon is costing me. Usually it's just a few hundred dollars and I chalk it up to business. Sometimes it's $10k and it can take months to resolve in a peaceful way. Other times I give up. It's not worth losing the Amazon marketplace, even though I'm right and anyone that actually read the situation would agree that I'm right.

From other sellers? Pretty rarely for my niches thankfully. A lot of damage can be done, not just through normal channels, but back channels too. Petty revenge could cost you.

Our company logo was trademarked so the box the product came in had our logo on it and we included a promote (stress ball) with our company logo on it and included that in the product photo.   When listings came up, we filed a complaint with Amazon legal counsel for trademark infringement and they pulled the listing down almost instantly.   


Before we figured out how to handle this via trademark, we noticed some sellers were charging for shipping based on weight, so we changed the listing to be 5000 lbs which made their shipping $10,000 on a $29 product.  We did however bait the seller by changing the weight to 60lbs, he then lowered the price to $0.01 and $29 in shipping, but we then put our listing on hold and overnight dropped the weight of the product to 0.01oz so he collected $1 for a $29 product that he had to fulfill.

2024-07-24,smallbusiness,"Its rough and happens a lot.  

I do have some thoughts on it. 

* Do you have to sell online?  I started off selling online 12 years ago but stopped 10 years ago.  I get plenty of business from local sales and commercial sales and word of mouth.  Once you list stuff online its out there for other to see and copy.  I noticed it happening to me.  They can't do it now though.  They don't know what my products look like or how well they sell. 
* Make your product better.  Most people will see and figure it out.   There is a big woodworking tool company in Ohio called Woodpecker Tools.  They make high end measurement things.  One off tools.  They have a red color and lots of Chinese companies try to copy the designs and look.  But you can tell by looking at them. And by using them.  So even though I know I can get a cheap copy for $10 I'll buy the real one for $100.  
* Compete against them on amazon. That is a great way to hurt their business.  Make it clear on the listing that you are the real deal.    There are amazon users that will try to help you.  See, I'm a amazon vine member. I get free items in exchange for doing reviews.  I make it a point to find companies that are based in the USA that are making and selling stuff on there.  I request the products and do great reviews for them.  Its not much help, but I Try to do my best.  
* Do the legal thing. Its possible, but hard.  They have 100s of cheap workers that can list things and move them around to stay ahead of you.  Amazon isn't exactly known for being great about it.  
* The first thing I would do is to watermark you images from your website.  Let them steal those.  Put you website address on the images.","I need some advice.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

I'm in the process of starting an online business where I'll be selling African handcrafts. I have the physical goods ready to go, and I'm looking for advice on how to set up and market my business across various platforms. Specifically, I’m considering:

1. Setting up a Shopify store: I’m thinking of using Shopify as my main online store. Any tips on how to best utilize Shopify for selling physical goods? Any must-have apps or features I should consider?

2. Selling on Amazon: I’m also interested in expanding to Amazon. For those who have done this, what are the key steps I should take? How do I manage inventory between Shopify and Amazon, and are there any potential pitfalls I should watch out for?

3. Creating a personal website: I want to have a personal website as a hub for my brand. How do I integrate this with my Shopify and Amazon stores? Should I use WordPress, or is there a better option?

4. Marketing strategies: Lastly, I would greatly appreciate advice on marketing my business. What are the most effective ways to market a niche product like African handcrafts? Any suggestions for social media, SEO, or email marketing would be fantastic.

If you have any experience or tips to share, please don’t hesitate to add them. I’d love to hear your insights. Thank you in advance for your help!"

2024-08-17,AmazonFC,"I am seriously considering leaving. I just talked to my husband about it. I am in fresh department so I don’t know how different the other sites are. Yes, this is definitely an easy job. Yes, there is no other job that as long as you have time you can take it. No questions asked. I love the friends I have made there, but management sucks. They don’t know what they are doing. I am in the top five for picking and receiving every single week. I bust my butt, but for what? Every critical role I have been in was taken away because I kid you not I did too good of a job. Imagine that. Doing too good of a job, and being pulled from it. Most of the associates working there can be my child or grandchild and I run circles around them. I am (58f). But I am sore. My body aches every day when I leave there, and I can’t do anything at home because I ache so much. I have been at Amazon for almost 4 years. I don’t have anything else lined up, but for my peace of mind I need to leave. I still feel horrible about it though because I have always been a responsible person. I don’t like feeling like this though, and in pain every day. I deserve better.",Been at Amazon 5 months. Worst job ever. The people suck. The job sucks. Management sucks.

2024-08-17,AmazonFC,"While I respect you for wanting to leave. Personally speaking I am very “content” being at Amazon 7 years. I understand the job ain’t for everyone but if you can handle the same thing everyday it really not as bad as people say it is. Yes it does suck and I bitch daily but ultimately it’s an easy job. 

1. I have better benefits than I’ve had at ANY of my previous jobs. I had a $96k surgery in 2022 and my insurance through Amazon paid it ALL. 

2. As much as I bitch about how crap our pay is on a daily basis and how we should make more (we should), I do make more than a lot of places without needing a degree. 

3. You will NEVER work a job that has better time off opportunities. Not only do I get sick, personal, vacation and UPT, but I literally just came back to work after taking a month off with personal leave of absence because I needed a break from being in that sauna of a warehouse. I knew I had enough money for bills and living expenses for the month so I was good to go. Just had to give a 2 week notice. What job will just let you take a month off for no reason? Not to mention some days I just decide to leave early which I can do at Amazon if I have the time to cover it. 

I also happen to like the people I work with. Well the ones I’ve worked with for years anyways. I truly have made good friends at work. 

Also I just wanted to add that if you’re going back to school (I’m assuming college) then you should WANT to work at Amazon cause they would be playin for your schooling? 

Like I say, Amazon ain’t for everyone and I understand why people don’t wanna work here but honestly if you can stick with it it’s not that bad.


My advice after being here 7 years is stay at the bottom. Then you’re invisible. Also don’t try TOO hard because then they will expect it from you everyday. I was Psolve for a while and I was NEVER offered the VTO because they “needed me”. Like they wouldn’t even tell me there was VTO and when a friend would tell me and I would go and ask for it they would laugh. I did that for a couple years before I realized it’s not worth it to me so I eventually stepped down. I’ve been asked many times to apply for ASM as well but I won’t. So many ASMs at my site say it ain’t worth it. So I stay comfortably at a T1 level and stay mostly invisible. 

Maybe it’s just me that feels this way but eh. Good luck on whatever you do next OP. I do agree tho fuck Amazon haha.",Been at Amazon 5 months. Worst job ever. The people suck. The job sucks.

You could literally get a CDL from Amazon and make more than an OM in under three months or use career choice and get a fully paid for bachelor's degree from WGU in like two years.

2024-08-18,ecommerce,"Hi, 

I understand that it might seem unusual for a service provider not to share details about their past work or clients. From our side, we sometimes have agreements with our clients that prevent us from disclosing their information. This is because the details of their accounts are their property, and they decide if and how their stats can be shared.

To make things easier and more secure for our clients, we only ask for payment once the work is done. This way, you don’t have to worry about paying in advance and can be sure that you’re only paying for work that meets your expectations. We’re confident that our clients will be happy with our services and choose to work with us again in the future. However, we also understand that some people might not pay after the work is completed, and we accept that as part of the business. This is a common practice that only legit Service provider follows. 

I’m not sure about Eric Walsh or his legitimacy, but I would suggest not paying anything in advance when working with anyone. If someone is truly passionate and skilled at what they do, they wouldn’t ask for money upfront because they’re confident they will get paid for their work. 

If you’re looking for help with selling on Amazon and want to avoid paying in advance, let me know. I can give you more details about how we can assist you. Thanks!

Thanks",Not much to add other than the above

Especially since I have 8 months of inventory at this rate of sales.  I’ve never had a customer request a refund after a discount.  They usually contact Amazon and Amazon’s policy is they don’t do that I believe.","I launched a product in November of last year. In my category, we'll call it ""Tool bags"". So the tool bag I'm selling is higher end and I want to sell it for $45+. Current price is $40 and we are selling about 125 per month.

We have cheaper competitors. A lot of them actually, and they can sell 400-600 with newly launched products as they are priced $20-30.

Our brand is brand new and this is our first product. Looking at companies like Apple, they never (or rarely) go into a discount strategy.

I'm wondering if I should be worried about lowering the price down to $35 and braking even to try to increase sales volume.

Should I be worried it will turn off previous buyers that bought it at a higher price? Is it going to be difficult to raise the price to $45+ later or should I not be concerned about that?

From my understanding, it seems this is a normal strategy for general Amazon sellers (not the big whales like Apple). Basically, be as aggressive as possible for say 1 year and then gradually raise the price? Is this a normal strategy that works?

2024-08-31,stocks,Amazon will become the amazon of africa,"Jumia was an interesting stock back in 2020/2021, seemed like everyone was talking about it in the bull market.

It's much easier to set this kind of network set up in America than Africa, and to maintain it due to geopolitical and terrorist risks. The types of products the different demographics would demand throughout the continent would be too broad to have efficiency with inventory.

Africa is a continent. It is the second largest continent on the planet after Asia. Africa is three times as large as the US on a land mass basis.

It’s impossible. The land mass is too big, the population too undocumented and the infrastructure too variable.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

You might want to just go through the process of setting up an example shipment from a foreign country - the Send to Amazon flow will give you an idea of what info you need, etc. Basically if your manufacturer is arranging shipping (which they almost always can), then you just need to create the shipment in Amazon, print off labels (for individual units if you're doing that vs. a manufacturer barcode) and each box. The manufacturer will apply them and ship everything to the Amazon warehouse, and it'll be received as normal. 

I haven't used Amazon's shipping, but you have the option to buy UPS shipping from them for international shipments, so you'd just do that, have the manufacturer apply the UPS labels as well, and then arrange a UPS pickup.","Hey everyone, I’m quite new to this and about to place my first bulk order from a China-based manufacturer (it's for a card game I designed and had made).

If my manufacturer is familiar with Amazon FBA’s packaging and labeling requirements, shouldn’t I be good to go with direct shipping?

Also, someone else mentioned that Amazon offers discounted shipping rates from China to their fulfillment centers. Does anyone have experience with this or know how it works? Could this mean I simply provide my manufacturer with a shipment label and only Amazon bills me shipping?

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!"

It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Right now investors will just settle for gains.”

2024-09-12,amazon,"I started watching the first episode of Rings Of Power.

I pressed Play—one full-minute ad. I can't skip.
Fifteen minutes later (or maybe 20, I don't remember), another unskippable one-minute ad. I took a break, then came back, ads.

I remember the ads more than the episode itself. All three items can be bought on Amazon (Amazon thinks customers are stupid). 

I gave up. I'm not going to watch episodes full of ads. They are distracting. They make the fast-forward rewind functionalities extremely painful. Even for Dune 2, which I paid for, I had to see them at the start or after a quick break.

I watch far fewer movies or series on Amazon now. A series really has to be unique to be worth watching. You don't know when Ring Of Power will start being interested. You can't fast forward the boring part because you must watch ads at set moments. You can't rewind if you missed something because you're afraid you'll have to watch ads.

Prime Video looks like a cheap version of Netflix. 
Now, Amazon asks you to pay more to avoid their ads. Why would I pay more when the more exciting stuff you have to rent or buy?

Although I really wanted to watch the show, it didn't look fantastic enough to go through this experience. Maybe it is, but you just don't care after a while.",No content (link post)

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

Excerpts from [article](https://fortune.com/2024/09/18/amazon-andy-jassy-ordering-full-time-return-to-office-rto-research-backtrack/) by Orianna Rosa Royle:

*Flex Index analyzed office requirements at more than 9,000 companies (who collectively, employ more than 100 million people) and found that around half of U.S. firms asked workers to return to the office last January.*

*Yet, only a third have kept their strict five-day in-office mandates in place.*

*Now, 37% of employers offer hybrid working instead—up from 20% at the start of 2023.*

*Despite the increase in headlines around firms forcing their workers back to their desks, companies like Amazon are actually exceptions to the norm. In fact, the data shows that workplace location flexibility is generally on the rise.*

*Although 50% of businesses were already offering their employers some flexibility over where they work last year, that’s now increased to 69%.*

&nbsp;

*“The data shows clearly that many companies—including Amazon—set hybrid work mandates, knowing compliance will vary,” Daan Van Rossum, author of the Future Work newsletter and founder of FlexOS tells Fortune.*

*“They’re playing a negotiation game, asking for five days to get three, as employees have grown used to the autonomy and productivity that hybrid work offers.”*

*Ultimately, despite Jassy’s call for workers to return to “the way we were before the onset of COVID,” Daan Van Rossum highlights that “in the pre-pandemic office, most people didn’t show up 5 days a week. Even then, office occupancy was usually 70%.”*

*“I expect a loosening of the policy as this public display of ‘office nostalgia’ versus the expected reality of offices—that they will still be half-empty even after the mandate goes into effect—will be visible to everyone.”*",No content (link post)

“Blackstone, the private equity firm led by Stephen Schwarzman, a billionaire backer of Donald Trump, was cited in the report for its roles in funding far-right political movements, investments in fossil fuel projects and deforestation in the Amazon.
“Blackstone’s network has spent tens of millions of dollars supporting politicians and political forces who promise to prevent or eliminate regulations that might hold it to account,” the report noted.
The Vanguard Group was included in the report due to its role in financing some of the world’s most anti-democratic corporations. ExxonMobil was cited for funding anti-climate science research and aggressive lobbying against environmental regulations.
Even in “robust democracies” workers’ demands “are overwhelmed by corporate lobbying operations, either in policymaking or the election in itself”, said Todd Brogan, director of campaigns and organizing at the ITUC.“",No content (link post)

In all seriousness, these didn't take off because they were difficult platforms from a website perspective. They came about because they were novel ideas, and they had the backbone to support it.

However have I got a opportunity for you! the job market took a huge tank in America and you could probably hire a developer around 70-200k a year, probably take a bit longer to start than an agency with just 1 or 2 developers. Do most tech startups fail, absolutely amazon didn't set out to be the next ebay, they had a better business model and scaled it over time.

I'd say you'd need at least a billion dollars to just materialize a platform like Amazon out of thin air and actually keep it afloat and pay for extensive marketing so it has the opportunity to survive. Just spit balling here.

Imo, the best bet is to try to compete with etsy. A lot of both sellers and buyers are fed up with etsy and they don't have any viable competitors. Granted, the lack of competitors isn't because no one has tried.. If you could make a quality platform that ONLY allows handmade goods and could reasonably compete with etsy you might be on to something. I still think it would take quite a bit of money.. You could probably pull it off for a fraction of trying to compete with Amazon though.",I know it's not easy but let's say I want to build a platform like Amazon and Alibaba so people can open stores on this platform!

2024-09-25,technology,"Here is how this is going to play out. It's a trainwreck that most of us can see coming a mile away:

* Top talent will straight up leave. They will be able to get jobs elsewhere.
* Reliable employees will start to slowly look for jobs. It won't be immediate - but when they do find work, even if it means a salary reduction, they will leave. Look for this to take 2 to 3 years. During this timeframe, they will not be nearly as engaged and their overall productivity will nosedive. They won't work extra hours. They won't ""go the extra mile"". And the certainly won't be good mentors for newer employees.
   * Smaller companies and startups will continue to be able to poach Amazon employees. They will offer lower salaries but temper it with full time WFH. Many of these companies will be competing directly with various Amazon services/products.
* Unreliable employees will continue to be unreliable. But now they are unreliable AND they are grouchy at having to commute into the office. So... even more unreliable.
* New employees will either be trained by formerly reliable employees who no longer care OR by unreliable employees who never cared in the first place.

Most companies will follow the big players - like Amazon - with this mandate. It totally sucks when you were recruited and hired with the promise of fully remote, then switched to hybrid, then full RTO. The company will not bump your compensation to compensate for the commute cost (car, time, gas, etc).

For example clothing has a higher return rate due size and fit, along with style expectation. 
If you sell a product that needs a lot of education to work, or if it just doesn’t do what it advertises to do, then your returns would be higher.

It’s rare that you get people that abuse the Amazon return policy, but this also depends on categories as those bad apples are more likely to abuse returns with electronics vs home decor.","Hi, I was thinking about starting to sell products through Amazon but I was wondering, how much impact do customer refunds have on my earnings?

So if you're new to Amazon or you suck at keeping a job at Amazon read this real quick.

1. When it comes to UPT, please be very mindful about that especially when you feel like taking off on a random Wednesday. You have to be very disciplined to finish your whole shifts especially if you're working overnight. Making sure you finishing your whole shift and getting that extra 50 minutes added onto your UPT matters keeping 10 hours plus of UPT is very important.

2. In my opinion, I think it's better to cross train than to just stick to one department just in case you don't like that department a lot of people don't like pick some people don't like Stowe most people like ship dog some people like pack some people like ICQAI had my experience with all of them and I say it's best to cross train Just so you have something different to do every other day or every other week so I can keep your job interesting.

3. When it comes to MET week/prime week you have to prepare yourself physically and mentally stretching is very important. You're in a warehouse. It's a very physical job. It's not like you're working at Wendy's or something making sure you have snacks water electrolytes, Tylenol, etc. keep that in your bag at all times. 

4. Last but not least anytime pay yeah don't use that unless it's like your first week at Amazon and you really need the money. Other than that you don't need to be using your Anytime because that will indeed fuck up your paycheck. I say use it for emergencies other than that leave it alone

This is the end of my list if you feel like I've missed something or you want to add please feel free to do so. I hope this helps."

2024-10-08,ecommerce,"Your own website is a must for brands, even if you have to ship the product yourself, but if you cannot and your margin allows it, then do Shopify and have Amazon fulfill your orders through MCF (Multi Channel Fulfillment) where Amazon fulfills your Shopify orders from your fba inventory.

Here are SOME benefits of selling on your own website:

You own the data, not amazon , analytics, so you can directly communicate with your customers.

Amazon can turn you off one day just like that, it can be an error, it can be because you missed metrics…

Better for branding, drive traffic from social to your own website which can have anything you want, including product information, registration, education, customer service, email list. 

It’s much cheaper to sell on your own website vs amazon.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

My advice to new 3rd party sellers is this: Amazon doesn't want you on its platform. They want factories/manufacturers selling directly to consumers. They literally talk about it all the time. Their three tenets are 1. Customers want a seamless shopping experience 2. Customers want the most options 3. Customers want the lowest price. 

#2. and 3. are 100% incorrect. They prove it incorrect everyday. My advice is your goal should be to GET OFF AMAZON. And that means starting a brand from scratch, preferably in a niche.

@ Amazon is a bit of hit-and-miss - You need to launch several products because some will fail. The consumers and the algorithm are fickle and seemingly random. You need to run multiple successful products because you sometimes random things go wrong with them. You need to have reserves of cash and stock to see you through difficult situations.

@ Try and avoid extreme seasonal products.

@ Run on minimal stock at first. FBM if you can, until you spin up some regular sales and you generate a bit of cash to invest in more stock.

@ Sell good products on well made listings. Compromised products on poorly presented listings will sell more slowly - and you can’t fix these original sins with advertising or hope. 

@ Advertising is oil for the gears, not fuel for the engine. If it won’t sell organically then improve the offer or junk it. 

@ Finally don’t piss all your profits away on advertising - you will need those profits to launch more products and buy extra stock for when your turnover grows. And you are planning on growing aren’t you?","I’m a new seller and learning this whole Fulfillment By Amazon business but I’m curious to know the profits of the members of this forum.

2024-10-15,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Honestly these guys are giving some great advice. I would add though that not all people can afford to launch products and have them fail just to learn the platform. If your already a seasoned seller and have been making consecutive profits month after month chances are you started 2017-2019. Starting an FBA business from scratch in 2024-2025 is a whole different landscape than it was back then. Look at what Amazon as a company is doing and where they are reinvesting their capital. If you have a budget of less than $10k to invest In Amazon I would really think twice before even jumping in. I don't agree with the fact that you need a lawyer to get through the USPTO trademark process, of course unless your not a US based company. Everywhere you can cut expenses will had to your bottom line. Look at your competition, the big guys. Check their gross rev numbers and see how consolidated the sellers doing biggest numbers are. If your biggest competitors are selling 40k + units a month and have 20k reviews stay clear from these type of products unless you can somehow improve the product in a massive way. 

The good thing is that Amazon isn't going anywhere anytime soon. They are rapidly reinvesting back into the company and have tons of growth potential. They are planning on grabbing as much market share as they can not only in the US, but every other capitalistic economy that is on good terms with the US. My biggest issue now is 
1. Capital constraints and inventory credit control 
2. The unknown. As in it will be my first year where I have 2 good products, numbers are looking good, and not sure if  q4  or holiday seasons in general really perform as well as people are saying.

This is a business and not a get rich quick type of deal anymore. Just another source of income to add to your portfolio. Many new businesses have great gross revenue numbers but still operate at a loss for many different reasons. Amazons a bull and you have to take it by the horns and make it work for you.","I’m a new seller and learning this whole Fulfillment By Amazon business but I’m curious to know the profits of the members of this forum.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmazonSeller) if you have any questions or concerns.*","A customer recently complained that one of my items is inauthentic. Despite submitting invoices from my supplier, Amazon refused to remove the complaint, stating that they were not able to contact the supplier and verify they are legitimate. 

This product's sales are quite slow and I do not mind never selling this item again if it means saving the time/hassle of fighting Amazon over this, but I am concerned about the impact the complaint will have on my account health (which currently shows as healthy \[236\] since this is the first time in 7 years I have ever had any issues). Will my account be at risk if I ignore this complaint? Or will it only be an issue if several complaints get lodged?   
"
2024-10-16,AmazonSeller,"It depends on a few factors, but generally speaking, the listing is removed, and will remain ineligible to be sold on your account in any way shape or form.

**How a Product Authenticity Complaint affects you:** If the violation has a corresponding ""AHR impact"" like low, medium, or high, then your Account Health Rating will be deducted points according to the severity (note: exact point values will vary relative to the severity and other internal factors, but you can track the difference in points by looking at your AHR before the deduction, and your points after the deduction). ""No impact"" means that no points have been deducted and only the listing itself is affected by being removed.

Example: If the impact is high, and your rating dropped from 244 to 236, then you know it was an 8 point deduction. Each violation is a one-time deduction, so in this scenario, your rating would remain at 236 unless acted upon by separate violations. If you accumulate enough violations to drop your score below 100, your account becomes at risk of imminent deactivation until you resolve enough violations to increase your rating to 100, or above.

**Appeal options for failed invoice/supplier scenario:** If you are unable to ""acknowledge"" the violation (admit fault to not providing valid, acceptable invoices) through the violation through the appeal button, and an invoice is the only option, then the violation will remain on your Account Health Page for 180 days, after which it will fall off and return your deducted points, but the listing will remain deactivated permanently for failing to prove authenticity.

If you're okay not selling the product, then it's best practice to delete the listing and allow the violation to fall off, unless you're comfortable ""acknowledging' The violation if you've been provided the option in the appeal button.

**Note about Acknowledgement appeals**: Acknowledging the violation, is **not** an admission to selling counterfeit product; it is an admission that you violated the policy which requires you to provide **valid** documentation from a **valid** supplier to verify authenticity. In other words, if your receipt/invoice does not pass Amazon's review, this means you ""violated"" their policy by not meeting document or supplier standards, and the ""acknowledgement"" appeal can be thought of as a forgiveness or pardon appeal. If the acknowledgement appeal is accepted, the violation will be removed within 60 seconds of submission. If the violation remains, then you'll know the acknowledgement appeal was unsuccessful and the violation will fall off after 180 days.

**Summary:**

1.Whether you choose to acknowledge the violation, or allow it to expire 180 days from the day it was received, the listing will remain deactivated due to the failed invoice review, and the listing should be deleted from your inventory to avoid further complications and clear up inventory space for easier inventory management.

2. Not all violations will be presented to you with an ""acknowledgement"" appeal, based on internal factors. You either have it or you don't. It's not an admission of guilt, but it's a business decision you have to consider if you're comfortable making it; for context it is intended to be use as a valid appeal option if a seller's invoices fail the review, and many sellers use it every day.

3. There countless variables in Amazon's review process that all boil down to one goal of verifying your invoice, and the supplier to verify authenticity and trustworthiness. Best practices for this situation are to consider your product sources with extreme caution and scrutiny, and implement your own strict vetting processes which may include things like consultation with a supply chain professional (not me), in-depth research, test buys, and ensuring that any final receipts and invoices meet Amazon's basic invoice guidelines, and you should have received a copy of these in your responses from Amazon. If you have a valid invoice from a valid supplier, and they can pass Amazon's review process, the violations can be resolved in as little as 1-3 days. Just try to avoid buying product indiscriminately and hoping for the best because **accumulated authenticity violations can put your account at risk**.

As always, follow Amazon's policies and verify all violation information with Amazon resources. Good luck.","A customer recently complained that one of my items is inauthentic.

### The most common ungating / invoice problems

* **Failing to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, stumbling through things asking forgiveness later, is setting yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Misunderstanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a real invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide an invoice from a proper source** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice** - often coming from youtube or people online posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same or they may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

2024-10-16,stocks,"""Honey, you're not going to believe what I just bought off of Amazon!""","https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html

Amazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.

AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.

An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.

Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.

""We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,"" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. ""Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form.""

Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.

Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.

""Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,"" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. ""Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.""

AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.

""These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,"" Garman added.

Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.

Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.

The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.

""Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,"" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. ""To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.""

Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.

One man shows don't even do this, why would a company with employees?

At LEAST get a second prime account for the company, and designate someone as the office manager that makes the actual orders, on a company card. Or get a business account and accept that you won't get free shipping, but you'll get some lower prices and they'll probably offset the shipping costs - and it'll DEFINITELY offset the costs if someone decides to embezzle via Amazon orders and you have no way of telling who it was because you're sharing a single account between 10 people.

This is a no brainer from a security perspective, I don't care how much these employees are trusted. You have to have a way to differentiate who did what or it becomes a finger pointing real life crime mystery WHEN something happens (not IF, but WHEN).","We currently have an Amazon prime account in the business owner's name that several people know the password to. We each have our company cards on the account as saved payment methods and the owner has her personal card on there. We use it to buy office supplies and also the owner uses it for personal things. Would it be better to switch to an Amazon business account? From my understanding, that would mean we'd get better prices on office supplies, but would we lose out on the prime benefits such as free 2 day shipping?

I was going through a medication change fatigued, dizzy for a whole week, took multiple LOAs, and told several managers about it. And guess what? They still wrote me up for not making rate. Then, while I was waiting for my accommodations to be approved, they hit me with another write-up for the same thing. Oh, and they stuck me in the back, forcing me to stow heavy items. Be careful y’all I’ve heard some managers purposely put people where they know you won’t make rate, just to write you up"
2024-10-19,amazon,"could you imagine being in the final round of interviews at AWS (which are INSANELY long and overdone btw) and they come out with this RTO policy. I’d IMMEDIATELY pull out and be looking at other tech companies. I cannot imagine anyone who values any semblance of work life balance applying to Amazon after all of this. It’s so funny cause even working in tech everyone I know wouldn’t go anywhere near Amazon cause the culture is so bad, and that was before all of this. There are so many other similar tech companies that will pay the same, if not better than Amazon and you can still have a life outside of work. Idk why anyone in their right mind would go and work there now, too bad for them! They’re totally losing out on good talent because of this",No content (link post)

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

The basic tenant of trademark law is attempting to confuse the customer.  We took various screenshots of both sites so they could be compared side-by-side and were able to use the internet wayback machine (I think that is the name) to show what their website used to look like and what it looked like after the ""updates"".

Fortunately, it was not an outright scam site, but a real U.S. company in the industry looking to expand their eCommerce presence.  We still don't know if it was them hiring a bad website developer, or if it was done internally with intention, but we came to an agreement on acceptable changes to their site.  Competition is fine, but you can't try to confuse a customer re: what company you are.

Amazon, well, is Amazon.  The fact that they let companies jump your ASIN and thereby benefit from your images, videos and copy is ridiculous.

Many sellers don’t know how to factor returns into their costs, which is why so many inaccurately project their margins.

Since I got started in 2018, these same issues have been present and have only become more challenging. I tell people all the time that selling on Amazon has become exponentially more technical to succeed (meaning that you have to run it like a business, requires in-depth knowledge to manage successfully over the long term, etc).

I’ve had to skip doctors appointments because they refused to let me have the day off. I’ve had to go into work sick, there was no DLS type system to get the day off, you either went in or had to use time off, if you didn’t have sick time you just got fired instead.

Amazon spoils the shit out of you. I can never go back to working Walmart or retail ever again. I couldn’t do it.","Left Amazon and March of this year. Since then it’s been HARD. Worked at fedex/ups and the work is so much more physical for less the pay (no AC and you’re climbing all through deep trailers). I even worked for the federal government and they paid me terrible and I had to pay for $10 parking a day , sit in traffic, and be around “professional” people who knew I didn’t belong. All jobs suck but Amazon is worth it push come to shove. If you’re planning on leaving Amazon just understand what you’re getting yourself into.

2024-10-29,AmazonFC,"Same. I left Amazon office last November and I HATE it. I thought coming to another office would be so much better because it’s a smaller, “family” company. WRONG. There’s no HR here, I have about 1 month of PTO saved up because we can never use it, don’t get breaks at all (im in AZ, so it’s not illegal for an employer to not give you a break) and I’m miserable. BUT, after months of applying at Amazon I finally got my old job back, the pay is a little more than what I made last time and it’s $1 more than what I make right now. I’ll take it. Even if it’s my old job, I seriously don’t care. I have such shitty health insurance at this current job, I haven’t gone to therapy in months because of how expensive it is and how shitty my insurance is. The benefits at Amazon are so good, a lot of people complain about the job until you leave and realize that no one else has benefits as good as them. And, work life balance.

2024-11-01,stocks,"Isn’t what Amazon has been doing over the past 10 years, reinvesting and moving profit to Capex? I wonder when it will end","Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to reassure investors who may be worried about the future payoff of the company’s massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

On a conference call with analysts following the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, Jassy pointed to the success of Amazon’s cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which has become a crucial profit engine despite the extreme costs associated with building data centers.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

I'm working with a manufacturer in China to private label and manufacture our product and after doing some research to understand the supply chain and make it effective and efficient, it looks like Amazon offers the ability to customize any outbound orders.

I only plan on selling DTC via our website and not on Amazon because I don't believe that's the correct route (for us at least) to build a brand and community around it. So my question is, since Amazon offers the ability to customize the package and not include their branding on it - does it still make sense to have our manufacturer customize the packaging for our product? Because in my mind, it's redundant. The customer would open two packages essentially, the first from Amazon and the other, from our manufacturer. It's a waste of cost and I'd rather allocate towards other expenditures. 

But would that be incorrect? Would Amazon ship out our product in the packaging that it was delivered in? Anybody whose been in this situation or has knowledge would be really appreciated here."

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2024-11-07,AmazonSeller,"This post mentions ungating, category approval, branding, brand approval, invoices, arbitrage, or a commonly related scenario. 

### Amazon policy, info, and enrollment pages

The following Amazon Seller pages are provided to ensure the most accurate info is the basis for discussion

**Brand owner registry** 

* Getting started - https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry    
* Overview - https://sell.amazon.com/blog/what-is-amazon-brand-registry   
* Requirements and eligibility - https://brandservices.amazon.com/brandregistry/eligibility

**Brand seller ungating**

* Category Requirements - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200316110
* Restricted Products - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164330
* Categories and Products requiring approval (see link to video within for invoice requirements) - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200333160) 

### The most common ungating / invoice problems

* **Failing to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, stumbling through things asking forgiveness later, is setting yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Misunderstanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a real invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide an invoice from a proper source** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice** - often coming from youtube or people online posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same or they may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

I have to say that Amazon is generally not a nice place to work. Amazon checks all the boxes on paper: competitive pay, benefits, time off. However, the toxic work environment and high turnover rates make Amazon an awful employer. 

Some of the laziest people I've ever met worked at Amazon. I've never worked at a warehouse where people do absolutely nothing all day. On the other hand, you have people who get hounded if they take too long to use the restroom. I've never had an issue with performance or TOT, but it's still not fair. It's obvious that favoritism comes into play too. For example, you'll often find attractive women, family members, etc in positions that are not tracked.

Amazon does not care about blatant drug use and criminal histories. This goes against the core value of ""Safety"", where Amazon supposedly cares about it. I'm not telling you how to live your lives, but this does highlight Amazon's hypocritical position. Amazon cares about safety enough to avoid liability. People who are not 100% safe (legally) are liabilities. However, working while intoxicated is not a liability because the blame can be shifted to the individual. It doesn't matter if someone was hurt. What matters is Amazon is not liable. Amazon also uses ""Safety"" as a mechanism to reduce headcount.

2024-11-07,AmazonFC,"I've been at Amazon for 4.5 years. It is far from the worst job I've worked. I've worked with lazier coworkers and their laziness always increased MY workload. At Amazon, another person being lazy really doesn't affect me. I'm responsible for my own work and that's it. Yeah, some managers suck at doing their job but I've worked under much more incompetent and blatantly shitty and horrible managers who treated me like trash. Here, my managers pretty much just leave me alone. I do my job so they have no reason to bother me. There are several managers I've never met who are in my management history but most of them I have met. Most weren't awful to work under cause like I said, they've mostly just let me do my thing. I have a good rapport with my PAs. HR is hit or miss but for the most part, I haven't had issues. I've taken plenty of PLOAs, 1 or 2-day medical leave, and FMLA with short-term disability. When I've had schedule issues, HR is mostly helpful. 

I've worked plenty of jobs that were far more toxic and terrible for my mental health, for far less money, and with no benefits or complete shit benefits that weren't worth paying for. As someone with only a high-school diploma, Amazon is a pretty cushy job. Pays well, has lots of benefits that are affordable for me AND my husband, good time off options, good schedules, and relatively low stress. 

Honestly, it's probably my number 2 spot for jobs worked. My number 1 job wasn't sustainable in terms of pay or benefits. I can't even afford to wait 30-90 days most jobs require before eligibility for benefits. So no point in leaving a job I'm content with. For $24.80/hr, I'm good. 

It may not be for everyone but it's also really not that bad of a place. 

Idc about anyone's criminal history. That's their business, not mine. If someone wants to work while drunk or high, that's also not my business. That's outside of my pay grade to worry about. I'm just a tier 1 so I'm gonna let the L4s deal with that. If they don't, oh well. Not my circus, not my monkeys.","I've worked at a Fulfillment Center, Delivery Station, and Sort Center.

I would say at least half of the people at my FC have been there since we opened in Nov '22 (or a couple months after, incl myself) As long as you're doing your job, it's practically impossible to have issues with TOT or rate. As someone that has worked in the corporate world as well, I can tell you there are always people that come to work high or having consumed alcohol. 🤷🏽‍♀️ It IS an individual issue because unless Amazon is going to give breathalyzers at the door every day, that's not something they can mitigate.

2024-11-08,amazon,"As a huge Mass Effect fan, I guess I need to find something else to be a fan of. 

I’m sorry but many streaming services are producing garbage material, effectively destroying amazing stories we have loved. Worst of all, none of you streaming services end the shows on logical and clean conclusions… you just randomly decide to not renew the show. 

Seriously Amazon, don’t waste your money. You won’t be getting me to sign up for Prime. I saw what Paramount did to Halo, and I saw what you did to Rings of Power. Honestly I never cared about the asshole “purist” arguments, it just was never a good show. The production value of your work was terrible on RoP. How is it that WETA workshop was able to develop amazing costumes and armors in the LotR trilogy for a fraction of the cost of your costumes and armors, and theirs looked better? (figures were adjusted for inflation) 

Halo completely went off script, and it was originally meant to be the Mass Effect series, but Paramount didn’t want to pay EA what they wanted. Apparently Amazon did. It was a travesty what Paramount did to Halo.

And Amazon [hired](https://fictionhorizon.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-the-works-at-amazon/) the production team responsible for **[Fast 9](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/f9)** and **[Uncharted](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/uncharted_2022)** which were absolutely awful films.

2024-11-08,AmazonSeller,"This post mentions ungating, category approval, branding, brand approval, invoices, arbitrage, or a commonly related scenario. 

### Amazon policy, info, and enrollment pages

The following Amazon Seller pages are provided to ensure the most accurate info is the basis for discussion

**Brand owner registry** 

* Getting started - https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry    
* Overview - https://sell.amazon.com/blog/what-is-amazon-brand-registry   
* Requirements and eligibility - https://brandservices.amazon.com/brandregistry/eligibility

**Brand seller ungating**

* Category Requirements - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200316110
* Restricted Products - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164330
* Categories and Products requiring approval (see link to video within for invoice requirements) - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200333160) 

### The most common ungating / invoice problems

* **Failing to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, stumbling through things asking forgiveness later, is setting yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Misunderstanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a real invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide an invoice from a proper source** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice** - often coming from youtube or people online posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same or they may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

I'm an inventor launching my first product in the Tobacco Accessories space.

I want any followup products within that sector to fall under one dba.

I have bath and kitchen inventions too I'd like to sell but under a different banner/brand.

So I have an LLC and then DBAs under that LLC. Currently I also have two service industry businesses as well.

How do I setup my Amazon Seller account please so that I'm able to do so legitimately via my LLC but also can have multiple Brand Pages (eventually) and that customers will see the Multiple Brand Pages and not my LLC name?

Thank you,

2024-11-14,AmazonSeller,"Most Amazon shoppers will not go past the first page of results - and so if you are surfacing the product to them on the top row and it's a good product, they will click it there and purchase it. 

  
The goal is to get your products on the first page organically, so you are not paying for your sales through ads. Many people focus on ROAS, but you should really be looking at Total ROAS when you are measuring your advertising efficiency. 

  
It takes time, careful planning, and the right approach to have your products ranking on the front page organically on multiple keywords, but it can be done. My advice is to focus on a few high-volume and a few mid-volume to start, see how you progress, and go from there.","I have been selling in Amazon for few months now. This is my first year into the holiday season (though I don't feel much of sales kick yet...)

I did not have ads running at first, because I have orders coming in without it. 

But when I lose my grace period with Amazon, I started to invest ads. 

Recently, I notice my orders are mainly comes in from the Ads, say 8 out of 10 orders would be coming just from the Ads...

Does it mean my organic search is just very bad? or is it because my Ads actually boosted my new listing to the front page and it somehow brings to the people that are more willing to purchase??

I love to see the orders coming in from ads, which means I am doing something right.

But at the same time, I hate to not be able to generate sales from my own without the ads.

Could anyone give me a short insight on it?"

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

2024-11-17,FulfillmentByAmazon,"I worked as an online business broker for 4 years, and now work for one of the largest Amazon software providers. I’ve seen a lot of hugely profitable businesses, and many failed attempts. 

Amazon has changed a lot over the last few years. 5+ years ago it was easier to make money - there wasn’t as much competition and Amazon fees were lower. 

Now, it’s extremely competitive. Even products that are fabulously branded, well priced with excellent reviews might make minimal profit. 

Chinese competitors are willing to sell at a loss to stomp out other sellers. 

BUT many people still do make money. It’s a combination of branding, product and reviews PLUS luck. 

I am referring to private label products.","So a friend of mine was recently telling me about how he just spent over 10k buying inventory to sell on amazon.  I didn't even know he had a brand or company or anything.  No, this is a side hustle where he's just selling Chinese made stuff via amazon FBA.  

I don't FBA, nor have I ever had any interest, and my friend makes more than enough where if this is a mistake, he'll live.  I'm familiar with the concept of FBA/dropsshipping and I thought with all the changes margins are basically nothing and even the best barely break 6 figures of profit.  I've read stories in other subs about people doing 10M in revenue and maybe see 60k pre tax.  Like, what's the point?  Another colleague at my company came from an FBA company that was doing $3M/yr in revenue but couldn't even sustain having 3 employees.  When I hear stories like that, it tells me there's no money to be made.  Especially if you're trying to compete against 'Amazon Basics' categories.

Short story long, is it even possible to make money on amazon still?  I mean real money, like 150k/yr take-home?"
2024-11-18,FulfillmentByAmazon,"I worked managing an FBA Amazon account for someone. He created products that only he sold so he governed the price and there was no competition. After 7 years, he reached 2 million/year in profit. He obviously sold a lot of stuff and a lot of the products he had to pay royalties on to other brands (won't mention who) but yes, a lot went into it. We got a lot of shipments in from China and we'd then ship to FBA's as our own brand.","So a friend of mine was recently telling me about how he just spent over 10k buying inventory to sell on amazon.

I'm familiar with the concept of FBA/dropsshipping and I thought with all the changes margins are basically nothing and even the best barely break 6 figures of profit.  I've read stories in other subs about people doing 10M in revenue and maybe see 60k pre tax.  Like, what's the point?  Another colleague at my company came from an FBA company that was doing $3M/yr in revenue but couldn't even sustain having 3 employees.  When I hear stories like that, it tells me there's no money to be made.  Especially if you're trying to compete against 'Amazon Basics' categories.

Short story long, is it even possible to make money on amazon still?  I mean real money, like 150k/yr take-home?"

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2024-11-19,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Edit: HappyKapow and I have a strong overlap of things we use AI for, so I rearranged my list for use cases that we share vs not and why:

Yes/same:

* 1. Seller Support
* 2. Listing optimization
* 3. Translation
* 4. Feedback analysis to fix issues -- we mainly do it for our own feedback, not competitors... that's actually a great idea from his team.
* 6. KW/ad optimization
* 7. CSRs

No/diff:

* 5. Data and marketing strategies - our current team/process significantly outperforms the AI + the AI hallucinates too much for our liking.
* 8. FBA reimbursements - we have template responses at this point + processes already + we do a lot less of this now with the new reimbursement process.
* 9. Visual content ideation  - no mainly because we have trusted outside design contractor partners instead of in-house.  This is something we're weak on and NOT pushing the envelope.

Us/new:

* 10. Project management helper - we have AI notetakers for all our internal/external meetings that then generate tasks, and we have AI integrated in our team chats to coordinate status/progress.  \~5% hallucination but works great otherwise.
* 11. Account management KPI helper - we created some custom GPTs that takes data from Amazon (reports + brand APIs), then tells us how we're doing period/period + relative to others in the niche.  Hallucinates \~5% as well incredibly helpful for our account managers who are typically good generalists but not strong analysts.
* 12. Analyst helper - we created some custom GPTs that replace our existing feed/file analyzers to help manage listing price and identify possible issues.  Hallucinates \~25% of the time so we still do most of the grunt work ourselves.

High level thoughts from the biz: The dream is an automated company that just does everything by itself; not there any time soon, fortunately for us meatbags.  Strategically we're trying to build/train custom GPTs to support specialists on the team, instead of just using the general GPT as tooling.","The main obvious one is product titles and description tidy ups.

Apart from this got GPTs translation setup with a bit of our SKU details, find it better than Amazons auto translations.

Images I find its not quite at the standard, some AI background stuff works."
2024-11-19,FulfillmentByAmazon,"We use Chatgpt extensively at our agency to streamline various Amazon work. While product titles and descriptions are a great starting point, there are a lot of other ways it can make life easier for sellers. Here are some examples based on what’s worked for us:

**1. Seller Support and Case Management**

* AI is a lifesaver for dealing with Seller Support! I use Chatgpt to draft clear, concise responses for opening or escalating cases, creating Plans of Action (POA), and appeals.
* I’ll often use Chatgpt's voice feature to talk through the issue and let it refine my response. It’s great for organizing my thoughts, making replies professional (especially when frustrated with inexperienced agents), and even venting without burning bridges.
* Keeping a single thread for each issue is a game-changer. *Example*: If an appeal gets rejected, I paste the rejection into the same thread, add call notes with Account Health, and get a polished new draft ready. Saves so much time and mental energy.

**2. Listing Optimization Beyond Basics**

* Chatgpt helps us refine bullet points and A+ Content to be keyword-rich, conversion-focused, and on-brand. It’s also great for testing different tones and styles.

**3. Translation with Context**

* Like you, we’ve found AI-powered translations (customized with product details) to be way better than Amazon’s auto-translations, especially when tone or cultural nuances matter.

**4. Competitor Analysis**

* Summarizing competitor reviews to uncover common pain points or unmet needs, which inform product improvements and marketing strategies.

**5. Data and Marketing Strategies**

* AI is like a virtual marketing assistant. I share campaign performance data and brainstorm strategies in real-time, or use it to evaluate data and plan next steps. It’s great for iterating on ideas and staying organized.

**6. PPC Ad Copy and Keyword Research**

* Generating keyword-rich ad copy and testing variations for Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, and Display ads. Helps maintain balance between keyword density and readability.

**7. Customer Support Automation**

* Templates for common customer inquiries ensure timely, professional responses that are consistent across the board.

**8. FBA Reimbursements**

* Pairing AI with analytics tools to identify errors (lost inventory, overcharges) and draft compelling cases for reimbursements.

**9. Visual Content Ideation**

* While AI visuals aren’t quite there yet, it’s useful for concept mockups or brainstorming creative themes for lifestyle photos and videos.

Honestly, chatgpt has been a game-changer for keeping things organized, especially with the ability to save threads and come back to them with updates. It’s super helpful for tracking everything in one Amazon account, but it really shines when you’re juggling multiple accounts, marketplaces, platforms, brands, or goals. It helps cut through the chaos and keeps everything in one place.","The main obvious one is product titles and description tidy ups.

If Brand X has a list of authorized resellers such as Walmart... buying from Walmart does not make you an authorized seller on Amazon. You would actually have to be on Brand X's list of authorized resellers and have that submitted to Amazon as proof.

Amazon has this in place to protect the brand. It's better that way otherwise the ASIN would be flooded with resellers whether the product was authentic or not; especially China sellers.

I would've deleted the listing that was flagged. Sell it on a different platform and move on. You can only have 1 Amazon account; it's not worth the loss of the account.","Hi all,

I’ve been a seller on Amazon since 2022 and have built a 7-figure business specializing in retail arbitrage (RA). Recently, my seller account was deactivated, and I feel their reasoning is unjustified. Here’s what happened:

Amazon flagged one of my products, an ASIN I sourced from Walmart. When they requested authenticity verification, I reached out to the brand owner and confirmed that the product was authentic. Walmart is also an authorized distributor for the brand, so there shouldn't have been any issue.

Then, they required me to complete their video interview verification process, which I did. However, after the interview, they kept requesting the same documents repeatedly—5-6 times in total. Despite providing everything they asked for, Amazon decided to deactivate my account, citing Section 3 of the Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement.

I know this happens to a lot of sellers, especially in the RA space, but it’s frustrating given the amount of effort I’ve put into building this business. If the deactivation turns out to be permanent, I’m considering suing Amazon for damages and to seek reinstatement.

1. Has anyone else experienced something similar, and how did you handle it?

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2024-11-23,AmazonSeller,"This post mentions ungating, category approval, branding, brand approval, invoices, arbitrage, or a commonly related scenario. 

### Amazon policy, info, and enrollment pages

The following Amazon Seller pages are provided to ensure the most accurate info is the basis for discussion

**Brand owner registry** 

* Getting started - https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry    
* Overview - https://sell.amazon.com/blog/what-is-amazon-brand-registry   
* Requirements and eligibility - https://brandservices.amazon.com/brandregistry/eligibility

**Brand seller ungating**

* Category Requirements - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200316110
* Restricted Products - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164330
* Categories and Products requiring approval (see link to video within for invoice requirements) - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200333160) 

### The most common ungating / invoice problems

* **Failing to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, stumbling through things asking forgiveness later, is setting yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Misunderstanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a real invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide an invoice from a proper source** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice** - often coming from youtube or people online posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same or they may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

2024-11-23,AmazonSeller,"Something similar happened to me. I sent in $64k worth of oil filters. Once checked in they froze my account and made me do an interview (2 month wait) where they requested all the invoices for all my inventory. After 2 weeks they said my invoice wasn’t sufficient and needed more documents. After 4 months of back and forth waiting 2 weeks between each email they “disposed of” my inventory and put me out of business. Very common right now not saying it’ll happen to you or everyone. But alot of people rn in the business are experiencing legitimate invoices not being sufficient. My aunt cuts hair for someone high up at Amazon and after telling her my story she said that Amazon is really only wanting brands to sell their own product so they’re getting rid of a lot of 3rd party sellers.

Demanded arbitration hoping for a settlement and essentially told to go f myself by Amazon lawyers.

Edit for clarification: The wholesaler I used for that product always worked for ungating and a lost inventory insurance claim. UPS lost my inventory and Amazon payed me 20k for that after 6 months of “investigation” so the wholesaler was legit.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2024-12-04,stocks,Who’s the bigger dirt bag here? Amazon for taking the money. Or the lawyer suing because Amazon won’t send its underpaid workers into harms way to deliver someone’s socks fast enough. Jesus wept.,"Washington, D.C.’s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation’s capital from access to Prime’s high-speed delivery.

The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has “secretly excluded” two “historically underserved” D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon’s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.”

In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.

The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience “significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,” the lawsuit says.

Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.

Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company said it would expand access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after a Bloomberg investigation found Black residents were “about half as likely” to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.

The ZIP codes in Schwalb’s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.

The Federal Trade Commission also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and “sabotaging” their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was “false on the facts and the law.” The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.

According to Scwalb’s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district’s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to “put an end to Amazon’s deceptive conduct,” as well as for damages and penalties.

To get packages to customers’ doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.

Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company said it recorded its “fastest Prime delivery speeds ever” in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.

In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

2024-12-04,stocks,Amazon should counter sue stating that DC has failed Ward 7 and 8 residents by not providing basic safety policing to ensure companies like Amazon and their workers feel safe to deliver packages.,"Washington, D.C.’s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation’s capital from access to Prime’s high-speed delivery.

The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has “secretly excluded” two “historically underserved” D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon’s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.”

In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.

The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience “significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,” the lawsuit says.

Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.

Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company said it would expand access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after a Bloomberg investigation found Black residents were “about half as likely” to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.

The ZIP codes in Schwalb’s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.

The Federal Trade Commission also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and “sabotaging” their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was “false on the facts and the law.” The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.

According to Scwalb’s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district’s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to “put an end to Amazon’s deceptive conduct,” as well as for damages and penalties.

To get packages to customers’ doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.

Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company said it recorded its “fastest Prime delivery speeds ever” in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.

In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

2024-12-05,FulfillmentByAmazon,"It’s funny because I had to restock and I decided to do half the shipment with AWD and the other half was sent to FBA using Amazon Global Logistics (AGL) and it’s my AGL shipment that had been delayed for months. It’s been at LGB8 for 5 weeks but hasn’t been checked in yet. 

Meanwhile my AWD shipment was shipped later and was checked in no problems. Either way, there logistics is unpredictable and needs to change. What bothers me the most is that they require a 2 week window for your deliveries, but they can’t even provide a proper check in times. All of these things are just reminders for all of us to try to diversify off of Amazon.","Like some of you, I was finally lured to use AWD earlier this year because of the lower fees, but I’m very much regretting it now. My current holiday shipment was picked up in China at the end of September and gated out on October 31. This shipment now has been delayed repeatedly. Across two containers, there have been a total of 10 delays, and I’m still waiting.

This is AWD’s third holiday season. Given that they have all our metrics—such as unit counts, dimensions, and timelines—when we book shipments, how are they still unable to plan and account for demand? 

The estimated delivery times they provide are completely unrealistic. Had I known this, I would have bypassed AWD entirely and shipped directly to FBA. I understood that gating out at the end of October would be tight, but this is a whole other level. One of my containers, which was supposed to be delivered tomorrow, has now been pushed back to December 10. The other container is now in an unknown status.

I've been selling on Amazon for 10 years and have never dealt with shipment delays like this. Unfortunately, our product is a gift item, and we do about 5 to 6 times the profit in December than we normally do. By the time this is processed, Christmas will be over.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

I see no option like for restocking fees.

Obviously, those fees are piling on and killing me.

The worst thing to do when selling on Amazon is fail to familiarize yourself with Amazon's policies, agreements, and guidelines. That one error is the single greatest reason behind nearly ALL questions about Amazon, account problems, and account closures including having funds locked away

These are resources you *need* to make use of *before seeking 3rd party responses which may not be accurate or up to date*

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

2024-12-08,stocks,"Amazon’s FCF is absolutely insane. Jassy is gonna Tim Cook this company towards over a decade of 20%+ CAGR. I would not be surprised if they end up #1 in market cap. Also Trump said today he’s agreed to meet Bezos for dinner. Bezos will suck up to get on Trump’s good side which is good for the stock.

Biggest risks are tariffs hurting e-commerce and antitrust but Amazon is diversified and printing enough cash to weather most storms. I think the worst is behind Amazon after they overspent in 2020-21 and got hammered by inflation in 2022. 

AI will also help them in so many ways. Fatter margins due to lower headcount, AWS, ad business, etc etc.","“Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and former CEO, has re-emerged as a driving force at the tech giant, dedicating 95% of his time to advancing artificial intelligence initiatives. Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bezos expressed his enduring connection to the company he founded 30 years ago, even after stepping down as CEO in 2021.

“My heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there, and my love is there,” Bezos said, reinforcing his deep ties to the company and its mission.

Bezos’s renewed focus on AI comes as Amazon seeks to assert itself in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. The company is currently developing over 1,000 internal AI applications and aims to leverage this momentum to remain competitive with industry giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.

One of the cornerstone projects under Bezos’s watch involves building a cutting-edge supercomputer in partnership with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon recently invested $8 billion. This supercomputer is expected to power a multimodal AI model capable of analysing images, video, and text, further enhancing Amazon’s AI capabilities.

Although Bezos stepped down as CEO to focus on his space venture, Blue Origin, he continues to serve as Amazon’s executive chairman, actively supporting CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team. His involvement mirrors a broader trend of tech founders, such as Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, returning to their companies to steer AI-focused strategies.

“I’ll always be there to help, and right now, I’m putting a lot of time into it,” Bezos said. “It’s super interesting, so why not?”

Amazon’s AI ambitions are supported by significant investments in infrastructure and talent. The company is betting big on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to enhance its services and operations, positioning itself as a serious contender in the ongoing AI race.

Bezos’s hands-on approach signals his commitment to Amazon’s future during this pivotal time in technological innovation. His involvement aligns with the company’s broader goals of integrating AI into various aspects of its operations, from customer service to cloud computing.

Bezos’s renewed focus on Amazon coincides with a surge in his net worth, which reached $228 billion last month, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The increase was driven by Amazon’s stock hitting a record $207.09 per share, boosting Bezos’s wealth by $7 billion as he continues to hold nearly 9% of the company.”

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmazonSeller) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Hi all, I am trying to get into selling on amazon, but one thing that has me really confused and hesitant about whether to sell as branded or unbranded is hijackers.

1. So, for all unbranded products, is it basically a given that the listing will be very easy for anyone to hijack?
2. **Could you just put your company name in the listing and in the photos, but sell the product itself as unbranded (i.e no logo on packaging)?** Wouldn't this prevent or at least deter hijackers? Would they be able to tell it is actually generic? Is this against terms of service?
3. If your product is unbranded, and it gets hijacked, is there anything you can do to remove those hijackers?
4. **How is it even possible for a listing to be hijacked?** Since, when you sell a product, it is assigned an FNSKU (which is unique to yourself). So, if someone were to try and sell the same product, wouldn't it have a different FNSKU? Thus amazon would know they are different products.
5. **Where exactly does the brand have to be for branded products?** Is it fine to just have it on the cardboard box? Or does the individual items themselves have to have a brand/logo on them? Or is just having it on the packaging enough (i.e the plastic bag the item is in). 

Ideally, I would like to sell my products without branding on them (for cheaper manufacturing), but still put my company in the listing & photos in order to build brand reputation. And later on, simply ship products do have branding on them under the same listing. (but as I understand it, is it incredibly hard to switch a listing from ""generic"" to ""branded""? And I would have to start off as generic).

Thank you in advance for any help!"

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmazonSeller) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Hi all, I am trying to get into selling on amazon, but one thing that has me really confused and hesitant about whether to sell as branded or unbranded is hijackers.

1. So, for all unbranded products, is it basically a given that the listing will be very easy for anyone to hijack?
2. **Could you just put your company name in the listing and in the photos, but sell the product itself as unbranded (i.e no logo on packaging)?** Wouldn't this prevent or at least deter hijackers? Would they be able to tell it is actually generic? Is this against terms of service?
3. If your product is unbranded, and it gets hijacked, is there anything you can do to remove those hijackers?
4. **How is it even possible for a listing to be hijacked?** Since, when you sell a product, it is assigned an FNSKU (which is unique to yourself). So, if someone were to try and sell the same product, wouldn't it have a different FNSKU? Thus amazon would know they are different products.
5. **Where exactly does the brand have to be for branded products?** Is it fine to just have it on the cardboard box? Or does the individual items themselves have to have a brand/logo on them? Or is just having it on the packaging enough (i.e the plastic bag the item is in). 

Ideally, I would like to sell my products without branding on them (for cheaper manufacturing), but still put my company in the listing & photos in order to build brand reputation. And later on, simply ship products do have branding on them under the same listing. (but as I understand it, is it incredibly hard to switch a listing from ""generic"" to ""branded""? And I would have to start off as generic).

Thank you in advance for any help!"

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

2024-12-14,FulfillmentByAmazon,"The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to pictures of children: 

Definition of personal information:

COPPA defines ""personal information"" to include photos, videos, or audio files of a child. 

Parental consent:

Businesses must obtain parental consent before collecting, using, or sharing any media that contains a child's image or voice. 


Call a lawyer immediately.

Demand that not only are the listings in violation are removed, but also demand that the selling account in violation, it's known address, IP and associated accounts are permanently banned. 

Request proof that the violating seller has been permanently banned from the Amazon platform.

The penalty for violations of COPPA is up to $50,120 per violation. Meaning that every time this photo of your child served by Amazon to a customer - the penalty is $50k per instance. Refresh the page - that's $100k. Refresh it again, thats $150,000.

This is a major fuck up on the seller's part and Amazon is liable for every violation from the second after you have notified them.

Send a printed copy of the letter via certified mail to Amazon HQ with attn made to Legal Department.

At minimum Amazon should ban the seller and make it as difficult as possible for them to ever sell on Amazon ever again.

Dear ********,
Your request for documentation is completely
inappropriate. ****** is the rightful owner of
the brand, and it is explicitly stated on the website
that they do not authorize third-party sellers. It is
your responsibility, as a seller on Amazon, to verify
proper authorization before listing any products
This is a clear violation of ****** intellectual
property, and no further justification or proof
is required from us. You are instructed to
immediately delete your listing of ******

to comply will result in the escalation of this

enforcement system, which may lead to the
deactivation of your seller account
No further discussion on this matter is necessary
Please confirm that the listing has been removed
without delay . We will file trademark violation
today


Btw it doesnt say that on there website it says

""for distribution, we manage everything internally and don’t work with any independent third-party distributors for wholesale purposes.""

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

2024-12-17,AmazonSeller,"Word of advice, anyone who is making videos sharing courses or groups to help you sell items on Amazon, is often a scam/sham. Do not fall for it.

Im somone who sells FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) on Amazon, where I fulfil the shipping when I receive an order as its better margins than FBA (Fullfilled by Amazon).

Essentially these ads give you the illusion of profit by showing you certain tools & apps to check the prices and potential profit margins they could make for selling on Amazon. It gives a breakdown of either FBM or FBA to see if its worthwhile.

These tools are just for information. ""Selling them to Amazon"" is not how this works.

Lets say you find a product for cheaper, and you want to sell them through amazon for a profit flip.  
You will need to register for Amazon, get approved (with correct identifications, tax documents) and then you can start selling.

But to sell certain products, you need to be ""approved"" to sell them if they are part of a brand, each brand will require different verifications and approvals for you to sell them.

Once approved to sell a product. You have the choice of FBM and FBA, FBM is a lot harder unless youre able to guarantee prime (NDD) delivery, which is EXPENSIVE. If going down the FBA, youre not ""selling to amazon"" - you essentially ship them to amazon (through an approved courier) then these will be stored (at a price) by amazon and you can control the pricing of these. Then when an order comes in, amazon will pack it and ship it (for a fee) for the customer.

Hopefully thats a good ""starter for 10""!","Hey all -

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

2024-12-17,AmazonSeller,"**Is Amazon a Scam for Sellers?**

You open a seller account on Amazon and list that $2 item for $11. 

Amazon account—either the **Professional plan** ($35/month) or the **Individual plan**, which includes additional listing fees are not included in this calculation.

After all the deductions:

* **Amazon fees** (15%)
* **Average shipping costs** (\~$7)
* **Supply costs** (\~$0.50)

You’re left with just **$1.85 profit**.

But the issues don’t stop there:

* Driving to the store or UPS adds more costs, often overlooked.
* Amazon charges your credit card or bank account for fees and shipping, while **holding your $11 sale for a month** in case of returns.
* If they find even **one policy violation**, your account could be suspended or closed, and **your money might be lost forever**. If you’re lucky, you may eventually get your funds back, but many sellers never do.

In the end, for small sellers, Amazon’s system can feel like a **scam**—a platform where the risk is high, profits are slim, and rules are enforced with little room for error.

Like many had said, you can’t just “transfer your credibility on Amazon to somewhere else - that’s why Amazon is Amazon and charges those fees.

2024-12-19,ecommerce,"it isn't exactly a 'transition'.  creating a website would be independent of Amazon. he would want to continue to sell on Amazon while creating a website to also sell the product.

consider it could take a long time to get organic traffic yet unless people Google the brand name.  in that case he should have a website nevertheless.  it would even lend credibility to the amazon listing.  but only if the website is done well.  if it is poor it could be a negative and hurt Amazon sales.

besides that it will take some advertising money.  if you advertise on Google Shopping it would be in direct competition to the Amazon listing so it would need to be priced appropriately.

2024-12-19,ecommerce,"There’s pros and cons - I just went though a Shopify vs Amazon experience and I’m still recovering 🙈
Amazon will insist to have the best pricing - so you can’t have your Shopify store “be the best” price. Which doesn’t necessarily matter as long as you own the listing. Generally customers do price shop and not everyone wants to shop on Amazon but it’s hard to compete with free shipping / free returns. Operationally I agree with everyone that’s saying go deeper with Amazon - however I hate that it’s a wall and if they say your done your done, you have nothing. 🤷‍♀️ I don’t love it for brand building - but brand building also comes with a cost.","My dad has been selling a bag dryer he invented on Amazon for over 20 years.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

I might get downvoted for this because I know some people don't like the Amazon mods, but maybe one of the mods will see your post and escalate it.  It's happened to me a few times where the mods escalated and was resolved because they initiated it.","I am a fashion designer, and I registered and operated a children's clothing brand in 2013, which we will refer to as LE. Around 2021, I opened a store on Amazon using this brand and company information. I planned to move to the UK and continue operating this brand. However, when I arrived in the UK and settled down in 2023, I intended to register my brand both in the US and the UK. I was shocked to discover that my brand had already been registered by an old client of mine in the US. I became a victim of trademark squatting. I didn't want to waste time, so I immediately contacted Amazon's customer service. The representative advised me that I could no longer operate under this brand and that I needed to create a new brand, company, and register a new store. Therefore, I had to spend a considerable amount of time designing a new brand, a new logo, sourcing custom packaging, and registering a new company. Once all these tasks were completed, I also registered a new store, which we will call LA. After making these changes, I decided to use this new brand for my adult women's clothing products. While preparing the new women's clothing collection, I downgraded the store to an individual seller account. Now that my first collection was ready, I attempted to reopen the store, only to find that my new store had been banned. The reason given was that they believed my LA account was related to my previous LE account.



I submitted a lot of evidence and provided detailed explanations. I am grateful to Amazon for giving me the opportunity to appeal through a video call. However, during the video appeal, whenever I tried to explain why I had to reopen the LA store, the interviewer was impatient and didn't allow me to finish my explanation.

2024-12-19,FulfillmentByAmazon,"You should be operating under one selling account. If you open a 2nd selling account, you need it to be registered under a 2nd business.

It's simple enough to add a brand to an existing selling account - hence no need to open a second selling account.

The only thing I can't speak on is you being in 2 different countries. But this is my understanding of the situation  - amazon doesn't want to see you with multiple selling accounts for 1 entity, as it is against their terms of service. But you can open a 2nd for a ""legitimate business purpose"", such as a brand new business (a 2nd entity).

You will need to appeal by admitting your mistake and prepping a plan of action to prevent you from doing this again, and maybe they will reinstate. Beyond that, there are services that will also do this for you and the pros are good at it. I would seek them out.","I am a fashion designer, and I registered and operated a children's clothing brand in 2013, which we will refer to as LE. Around 2021, I opened a store on Amazon using this brand and company information. I planned to move to the UK and continue operating this brand. However, when I arrived in the UK and settled down in 2023, I intended to register my brand both in the US and the UK. I was shocked to discover that my brand had already been registered by an old client of mine in the US. I became a victim of trademark squatting. I didn't want to waste time, so I immediately contacted Amazon's customer service. The representative advised me that I could no longer operate under this brand and that I needed to create a new brand, company, and register a new store. Therefore, I had to spend a considerable amount of time designing a new brand, a new logo, sourcing custom packaging, and registering a new company. Once all these tasks were completed, I also registered a new store, which we will call LA. After making these changes, I decided to use this new brand for my adult women's clothing products. While preparing the new women's clothing collection, I downgraded the store to an individual seller account. Now that my first collection was ready, I attempted to reopen the store, only to find that my new store had been banned. The reason given was that they believed my LA account was related to my previous LE account.



I submitted a lot of evidence and provided detailed explanations. I am grateful to Amazon for giving me the opportunity to appeal through a video call. However, during the video appeal, whenever I tried to explain why I had to reopen the LA store, the interviewer was impatient and didn't allow me to finish my explanation. Instead, they asked me many unrelated questions. Every time I mentioned that I had to abandon the LE brand, they interrupted me and impatiently stated that they were not interested in hearing that and needed to ask other questions.

2024-12-19,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Don’t lose hope. If possible, start the appeal process again. It seems like the agent handling your case may have had a bias or a misunderstanding. Also, keep in mind that Amazon cannot rely solely on a verbal explanation for why you had to open two accounts. From their perspective, anyone could make a similar claim, and they’d have no way to verify it.

This is similar to Amazon's policy on seller complaints. Sellers aren't allowed to report competitors for reasons that don't align with Amazon's guidelines. If they did, every seller would be constantly filing complaints against their competitors to gain an edge.

I had a similar experience with a client whose account was closed because Amazon linked it to an account the business owner had created back in high school. It took several appeals and about 10 different versions of a Plan of Action, but eventually, the account was reinstated.

Stay persistent and refine your approach with each appeal. It’s a tough process, but it’s possible to succeed.","I am a fashion designer, and I registered and operated a children's clothing brand in 2013, which we will refer to as LE.

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

The only misstep might be having one party register and realizing another party needs to be actively managing it.

You might consider having your authorized distributor on Amazon set it up for example.","We don't sell directly on Amazon. Some companies sell our products on Amazon (they might get their products either from us or from our distributors) and we never really thought much about it as at the end of the day they're still selling our products and our main focus is B2B and big distributors. 

I recently came across Amazon Brand Registry and I'm doing some research in it (there's ton of websites regurgitating the same thing and Amazon support is not available unless you're already a seller) .

2024-12-19,technology,"From the article:

Why it matters: It's not just corporate employees leaving over the company's aggressive return-to-office policy that Amazon has to worry about. Workers at seven of its facilities walked off the job this morning in what their union is calling the ""largest strike"" against Amazon in US history.

According to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 10,000 workers at ten Amazon facilities, warehouse workers in cities including New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco are taking part in the strike.

The union had given Amazon a December 15 deadline to begin talks with employees, but the company has refused to negotiate contracts with unionized workers.

""If your package is delayed during the holidays, you can blame Amazon's insatiable greed. We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,"" Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien said in a statement.

""These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they've pushed workers to the limit and now they're paying the price. This strike is on them.""",No content (link post)

You would have to assume that their next step will be to fire all the striking workers for missing shifts. 

Then it will go to court, which will take months or years. And in the meantime the workers will have to find another way to make ends meet. It's unfair to them, but this is late-stage Capitalism.",No content (link post)

When you speak to them they will ask ""do you sell with Amazon FBA?"". If your answer is yes you will owe every year plus LOTS of penalties and interest. Total bullshit, but good luck fighting it.

So be careful where you register for sales tax. At this point, where Amazon is already collecting sales tax, I recommend only registering in your home state if you only sell on 3rd party marketplaces.","I plan to sell branded items on Amazon FBA, and I’ve learned that Amazon can store my products in multiple states, which might create physical nexus in those states. From what I understand:

1. I don’t need to apply for a seller's permit in every state because Amazon, as a marketplace facilitator, collects and remits sales tax on my behalf in most states.
2. However, I’ve heard that in states like California and New York, I might still need to apply for a seller's permit due to their stricter nexus rules, even if Amazon handles the sales tax.

**My questions are:**

1. Is it correct that I don’t need to apply for a seller's permit in every state where Amazon stores my inventory, except for stricter states like California and New York?
2. As a small business just starting out, do I need to worry about income tax obligations in states where I might have physical nexus, or is this usually not an issue at my scale?"
2024-12-21,FulfillmentByAmazon,"To be legal, any state where a transaction is made, you need a permit (however the state rquires) and you need to comply with the tax laws of that state. 




Last time I checked Amazon submits sales taxes on your behalf in all states but 3 (not sure of this has changed). But you still have to file a $0 return whenever each state requires (monthly, quarterly, or annually).




You are very unlikely to get in trouble of you do this until you are of a size that becomes noticeable by the state ($1m+ in sales, i assume). But of you do not follow these rules, you expose yourself to risk of audits, fines, etc.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

### Amazon policy, info, and enrollment pages

The following Amazon Seller pages are provided to ensure the most accurate info is the basis for discussion

**Brand owner registry** 

* Getting started - https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry

* Categories and Products requiring approval (see link to video within for invoice requirements) - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200333160) 

---

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

I think 2511 and 2512 are both self-reported documents suggesting that no actual independent testing has been completed.

This would explain why you didn’t need these documents before but you need them now. How familiar are you personally with the FDA requirements for cosmetics?

They have access to a massive dataset to find these things.

But they can only get the data from sales made from their store.

2025-01-02,smallbusiness,"Amazon definitely disrupted a lot of industries

If you actually are providing some service, which includes a place for them to pick up a product or you deliver it, there’s nothing stopping you from selling it at a premium price compared to Amazon(and nothing wrong with it)

There are a few things I source at Amazon not even so much because of price but because it’s easy.. and there are some odds and ends things that my vendors either don’t really supply anymore or the price just seems absurd… so I might buy it from Amazon and sell it for a profit, but it’s usually part of a bigger deal… and not necessarily common


But what I can tell, you is most everything I sell you can find online much cheaper than I will sell it for and while you might not find it all at Amazon, there’s plenty of people out there who have that kind of an approach where they’re just looking at volume

So if I was gonna sell something for $400 that I pay $250 for you could probably find somebody selling it for 285 or 300

The product I sell does require some set up, which makes Amazon not the best source for it, though there are dealers like me who might utilize their website to market their products and they might charge additional fees for some of these things

But sadly, the days where you could make a decent living being that middle man on a lot of products cause you had connections with distributors is coming to an end. 

At one time I used to sell a lot of a cellular phone accessories, for example, and I had accounts with the main vendors… I suppose I still have those accounts, but a lot of those vendors have closed

At one time I could pay two bucks for a car charger and sell it for $10 which was still a lot cheaper than what the retail stores or a Best Buy would sell it for

I don’t sell as many cell phones as I used to and a lot has changed in regards to the accessories people buy, and it’s just not worth me trying to carry cases in different colors and for different models and fewer people are buying things like car chargers, but the truth is, you can get everything at Amazon for roughly the same price as I can get a whole wholesale

But a lot of people still go to a Best Buy and pay extra because they want it now or they want to be able to see it…

But if I’m gonna buy a cellular phone accessory, I get it from Amazon","I buy stuff from like 10 different distributors and sell directly to customers.

2025-01-03,smallbusiness,"In my industry vendors had to pick sides. Retail vs online.
So the majority of my vendors (I have well over 250 as this is retail) make us retailers sign exclusivity agreements to never sell on Amazon. This creates an artificial price floor which allows us to survive. So there isn’t some 20 yr old selling out of his parents garage with no overhead costs.
This benefits the vendor because more sellers not only equals more products going to consumers but more sales as 100s of retailers have to fill hundreds of displays.

What I also have seen is vendors decide to go the Amazon route. They all suffer.  The loss of up to 40% (really it is that much) of sales revenue is not sustainable. The only way it works is to increase units sold by an equivalent amount.

BUT with out hundreds of retailers filling out hundreds of displays across the country they end up with a net decrease in units sold. The first couple quarters look great as Jim’s warehouse fills out their shelves but they all get a huge kick in the pants when the retailers walk away.

It has become an industry joke, with literal gambling/bets on how long it takes the vendor to come crawling back. (Generally about 4-6 quarters)

The thing is even with all the evidence and trade representatives clearly explaining the problem they don’t listen because that is a problem for an another financial quarterly report.","I buy stuff from like 10 different distributors and sell directly to customers.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

I need some advice on a tricky situation with Amazon. A while back, I started selling on Amazon but made a big mistake—I was listing items on other people's listings without fully understanding the rules or ethics of it. I realize now that what I did was wrong, and I’ve moved on to running a Shopify store, which has been a great learning experience.

Now, I want to return to Amazon and do things the right way by building my own brand and following all the proper guidelines. However, my account is permanently banned. I’ve tried everything to reactivate it, including reaching out to 20-30 Chinese sellers for the documents Amazon requested, but none of them could provide what I needed.

At this point, it feels impossible to get my old account back.

I’ve heard that you can’t open a new Amazon account if you’ve already used your SSN, which is my current roadblock. I’m planning to start an LLC eventually and register a new account under that, but I’m not quite ready to set up the LLC just yet.

So, my question is:

* Is there any way I can legally and ethically create a new Amazon account before my LLC is ready?
* Are there any steps I can take to rebuild my presence on Amazon without violating their terms of service?

I want to make sure I do everything above board this time. If you’ve been in a similar situation or have any advice, I’d really appreciate your input!

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide."

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

Do not list the product.","I’ve just started doing online arbitrage and reselling products on Amazon.  I’ve come across a product on Walmart that has a generic brand “Super Value” that is also selling on Amazon for 3x the amount.  Amazon has no restrictions to add this product ASIN into my inventory.  I went ahead and bought several units of the product.

After purchasing the product, I did some more research on the Amazon listing.  There is only one seller and the listing shows that the product has a unique “brand name”.  However, the product and packaging/box itself is exactly the same as the one on Walmart, including the generic name “Super Value”.  The listing is new (~90 days) and the seller has been the only since it was created.  The seller has only one review, but is listing other variations on the product on other listings, and has no other product types. 

The question is, do you think it’s worth taking the risk to sell the product on the same listing to make 70% ROI?  The manufacturer on the Amazon listing and where I purchased it from (Walmart) is the exact same, and all the specs and the packaging/product is the same.

I wanted to make this post as a warning to new sellers as well as those selling the past few years. I know there has been talk about return fees but I don't believe many realize how bad they truly have gotten. For a small business, these fees run the risk of putting someone completely out of business.

As a bit of background, my company has been selling on Amazon for 7 years. We own a brand and were recruited directly by Amazon.

In the first 3 years of selling: Amazon lost 0% of our inventory

Year 4 of selling: Amazon lost 1.5% of our inventory

Year 5 of selling: Amazon lost 2.8% of our inventory

Year 6 going into year 7 of selling: Amazon lost 8.2% of our inventory.

For the most part prior to this year, they refunded on cost more or less. When going into the sixth year we did notice it took months to sometimes get the money back though. This caused us to have to hire another employee just to follow-up on Amazon cases.

Recently(last six weeks) they lost another shipment.

This particular lost item retails for $120. The cost to bring this item into the USA is $68, as shown by my invoice provided to amazon. On top of this, we pay clsoe to an additional $20 in shipping and customs clearance, also shown by Department of homeland seurity invocies and paperwork.

Guess how much amazon reimbursed us for the items lost? $21/pc. Be vigilant everyone.

2025-01-07,AmazonFC,"It sucks that I had a horrible experience working at costco tbh. It was probably just my specific location that was bad the every manager and supervisor there was fake asf. After the seasonal period ended (like most jobs, seasonal employees are let go after christmas), every seasonal employee gets a call after two weeks and we're either offered a full time job or they'll put us on a call back list if they're not hiring anymore. I ended up having to reach out to my store since they never called me back and the head manager legitimately said ""You're not even on the call back list"" after months of praise from my coworkers and even supervisors. I swear like 10 different people, including management, there told me that I'm most likely getting rehired. And when I shopped there a month later everyone was surprised and couldn't figure out why I wasn't on the call back. My guess is that the one single manager that didn't like me had something to do with it but oh well who knows. And here I am now at Amazon ...

This may help Amazon in the short term but I'd guess everyone will eventually have a ""middleman"" charging them a premium for adding labels to finish their manufacturing process.

Also, this is what, 0.1% of your annual revenue? I don't think its really that big a deal.

I think Amazon should split the difference at least since you are losing potential profit.  Really hurts sellers like me that are sole proprietors and do their own packaging.

There’s a seller on Amazon who’s selling a counterfeit version of my product and using my brand name, which is registered with the Amazon Brand Registry.

But now, they’ve submitted what looks like a fake letter of authorization claiming I gave them permission to sell, and Amazon reinstated their listing.

I even did a test buy and submitted a detailed PDF showing side-by-side comparisons of the counterfeit product versus the real one. It includes photos, videos, and clear evidence that their product is fake. But it feels like Amazon isn’t actually reviewing the evidence because I keep getting generic, automated responses.

I’ve asked for a callback over a dozen times, but nobody has reached out to me. Meanwhile, this counterfeit product is hurting my brand and scamming Amazon’s customers.

The proof I’ve submitted is clear-cut and undeniable, but I’m not sure what else I can do at this point to get Amazon to take action. Has anyone been in a similar situation or know how to escalate this?

Thanks so much for any advice you can share.

Update: Sorry for not making this clear but we do not sell on Amazon, we only sell through our Shopify store.

2025-01-12,FulfillmentByAmazon,"It says ""coming soon"" for me. Here is the link: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/brand-analytics/dashboard/customer-journey","Amazon has introduced a powerful tool under **Brand Analytics**: **Customer Journey Analytics**. It provides a clear, visual breakdown of how customers interact with your brand—from **awareness** to **purchase**.

This dashboard spans **all your ASINs at the brand level**, helping you understand key metrics like branded searches, store visits, and where customers drop off in the funnel. It’s a goldmine for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing your customer experience.

Imagine the possibilities if Amazon added deeper granularity—breaking this data down to **specific ASINs or categories**. While tools like **Brand Metrics** in the advertising dashboard provide some details, having this level of visual insight could transform how we approach advertising and product strategies.

For example:

* Spotting **exact drop-off points** for a specific ASIN or category could enable ultra-targeted solutions.
* Fine-tuning campaigns based on precise customer journey data.

Amazon is moving toward making these insights more accessible and actionable, which is exciting for sellers like us who want to stay ahead. Stay tuned for a deeper dive!!

2025-01-12,ecommerce,"Do you have any idea how f’n big Amazon is? Even an operation that is just 5% of Amazon would be massive. 

Consider that the tiny local hub, or whatever they call it, near me has maybe 200 of those nice little Prime vans in the lot coming and going. The massive complex they built by the airport thats feeds all their fulfillment centers is nearly a million square feet per floor. 

You could take the reported numbers of Amazon gross and net and sorta figure a cost per time to operate and scale done from there but it’s sorta apples and oranges because Amazon’s scale and tech that we don’t have greatly reduces costs. Supposedly they make $1m per minute in profit it Google is correct.","Hey guys!!

I have a running website which I get sells on but I would like to start to sell on Amazon as well. 
2025-01-11,AmazonSeller,"I wouldn’t start out selling clothing on Amazon. Let’s say you have one product in 4 colors and 5 sizes. That’s 20 different variations to juggle. Now add 5 more similar products and you’ve got 100 unique SKUs. That’s going to be a lot of work. 

That’s just a headache though. The real problem is the return rate. Clothes can have a return rate of like 25%, which is just crazy to me. I average less than 2.5% in my niche. 

Have you looked at your competitors? You can find nice, name brand clothes on Amazon if you know exactly what you’re looking for. Otherwise, you’ll be wading through page after page of Chinese junk peddlers. Look at their brand names. If it’s some ridiculous letter-salad of a name, it’s a Chinese seller. Amazon swears they don’t, but they have a lot of advantages over US-based sellers. 

The steps to get started are a pretty broad topic. There’s actually a lot to know and a lot to learn. I spent over a year just learning before I ever spent a cent on my first product. I’d check out YT. Find some good content creators and get learning.",I wanted to know what steps is needed for me to sell my own clothing line on Amazon.

Create a new Seller Central account with a dedicated business email address. Once that's done, go straight to Brand Registry and register your brand. 

All this forms up your foundation, upon which you'll then start adding your items to Amazon and selling them, either by self fulfillment or FBA.

*[...] As of this month, employees at Amazon and AT&T are required to start showing up in the office five days a week. Then, on Tuesday, news broke that JPMorgan is preparing to revoke the hybrid privileges of about 40% of its workforce. (The other 60% are already required to come in every day).*

*[...] Whatever old-school CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Andy Jassy may think of it, remote work is here to stay.*

*For one, take a look at the stats. The economist Nick Bloom runs a monthly survey of American workers that tracks the prevalence of remote work. At the peak of COVID, in the spring of 2020, as much as 62% of work across the economy was being done from home.*

*As the pandemic eased, that number came tumbling down — to 37% at the beginning of 2021, 33% in 2022, and 27% in 2023. The work-from-home dream appeared to be fading.*

*But in the two years since, something odd has happened. Despite all the headlines about companies getting rid of hybrid arrangements, the actual prevalence of remote work has barely budged. Last month, the share of work-from-home jobs remained at 27%.*

*[...] In fact, when you zoom out and look at the current status of work from home, what you see is nothing short of a sea change. In 2019, Bloom and his team estimate, only 4.7% of work was performed from home.*

*That means the current level of WFH is still six times larger than it was before the pandemic. For all the Amazons and JPMorgans that are reverting to their pre-COVID policies, the norm remains tilted to hybrid work to a degree that would have been unimaginable back in 2019.*",No content (link post)

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

* Categories and Products requiring approval (see link to video within for invoice requirements) - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200333160) 

---

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

2025-01-18,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Just wait until they get pissed, freeze your disbursement from Amazon (it can and does happen!). I","Important note: I'm **NOT** referring to **sales tax**. Amazon collects sales tax on seller's behalf and that is largely taken care of.

**Background**:  
After being hit by the California income tax letters demanding that we file a CA return and apportion a part of our state income tax to California, I started digging in and doing a thorough research on the all tax requirements that Amazon sellers are bound to.  Here is what I found:

**Income Tax:**  
\- **About 75% of states REQUIRE you to apportion income taxes to their state even if you had $1 in inventory** at an FBA warehouse in their state. Amazon distributes out their fba inventory to almost every state.  The rest of the 25% states have a minimum inventory limit amount before you have to file with them.  
\- Some states that don't have income tax, still REQUIRE you to do an an annual report.  
\- If you have an S corp, then every member has to file a return in that state as well, apportioning the amount they earned from that particular state. Some states do have 'composite returns' that you can file as well, but that is a separate filing from the corporation return, so it's still 2 filings.

**Minimum Franchise/Privilege Tax**  
\- About 44% of all states REQUIRE you to pay a minimum tax for the privilege of selling in their state. They will call it Franchise tax, or Privilege tax, Excise tax, Minimum Fee, Business Tax, License, gross receipts tax, entity tax. Even if it's $1 in sales.

**Consequences:**  
\- **Fines, penalties, and then you will have to amend all previous years of returns, and for all shareholders every time a state decides to clamp down. This is a huge burden in cost of compliance. There are 50 states. You will have to amend your return 50 times (for each state that decides to go after those who haven't done a return)** (this is rounding up of course for sake of simplicity). The other option is to just have returns that are always incorrect and you will just have to keep paying income taxes, over and over again as they will overlap to what you paid in your home state if you don't amend every one of them.  
\- Amazon shares data with state governments showing them what business sold to their state and how much inventory that seller had in that particular state through amazon fba.  
\- I'm not even bringing up the sales tax reporting requirement that requires you to file a report REGARDLESS if amazon collects or not. You still have to tell states how much was sold, even if taxes have already been paid by Amazon. Although some states don't require this.

**Common misconceptions**  
\- Public Law 86-272 doesn't allow states to do this. If you have zero inventory in that state yes that is true. But if you have even $1 of inventory in that state, that law does not apply.  
\- Selling as a sole proprietor instead of s corp: this still requires you to do personal returns in each state you had inventory and apportion your income to that state, and some states still charge privilege minimum franchise fee and require you to file as a business there as well regardless of you being a corporation or not.

**Do I have this right? Or am I missing something? Is almost every single company that sells on Amazon FBA not compliant, and will get hit by California style letters soon?** I know the big brands are obviously probably compliant, and I know there were a few folks on reddit that I found that said they actually did file in most sates, but there is no way that smaller companies are doing this. No way a small LLC or S corp who sold couple hundred or even $1,000 of product to costumers in California is paying $800 to California for privilege tax and another x amount to a tax guy to file his return there."

I went to try to doomscroll today on TikTok but the app was down and it wouldn't let me use it, I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a minute or two. I can't continue work today or come back on Monday, and I can barely get out of the parking lot  right now,

After that, I tried to open up tiktok again but it didnt work, I started having a second meltdown. After that i went outside to touch grass and it burned, i ran back inside my car where im currently shaking still. I tried to watch youtube shorts but it was too much for me to handle, i cant handle this man. TikTok is my life, I wished to have my last doom-scroll session. I rather jump off a bridge for TikTok to come back… I hope trump does something about this.. i just wanna scroll on tiktok again..

Hopefully…

Its been a few more minutes.. My whole family is struggling without TikTok, We are currently in the streets looking for food… Without TikTok I’m dying for it.. I’m starving, Please help me… i just want it back so i can doom-scroll some more…

2025-01-19,dividends,"The one thing I want to point out is, in retirement, you will be an income investor and not a growth investor.  During your working years, you invested in a way to accumulate wealth.  In retirement, you switch over to wealth preservation phase.  In this new phase, the goal is not to gain wealth but to protect your wealth.  You want your assets to generate income to replace the income which you once received at work.  What generates the income is the dividends given out by your stocks.  Though their market prices may go up and down, you are not concerned.  Your only concern is if the stock can continue to pay their dividends. With the exception of Netflix and Amazon, all the stocks you mentioned have a long history of growing dividends.  You really don't need to review your portfolio frequently.  Nevertheless, if investing in ETFs will give you more comfort, I would recommend DGRO and a few covered call ETFs, like JEPI and JEPQ.  DGRO holds all the stocks you mentioned except Amazon and Netflix since they don't give out dividends.  JEPI holds the stocks on the S&P 500 index and write options on them to generate a regular monthly dividend.  JEPQ does the same but holds stocks from the NASDAQ index.","I have stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Pepsi, McDonald’s, and Chevron. Most of them are doing well, except for Netflix, which I recently bought. I’m 60 years old and planning to retire in 5–7 years. I’ve also recently started investing in ETFs like SCHD and VOO after learning more about them.

To be honest, I’m finding it stressful to manage individual stocks and constantly check on them. I want something safer so I can retire peacefully.

If you were me, would you sell the stocks and move into ETFs now, or would you keep the stocks? My plan is to start selling investments after 65 if I need extra funds beyond my pension. If I don’t need the money, I’d consider holding onto them.

I’m single, so my main goal is to ensure a secure and stress-free retirement.  
Thanks for your advice!"
2025-01-19,stocks,"Sonos had a reputation for quality and then they foolishly started making components incompatible with each other.  That preceded the software and other fumbles you mention.  

It’s a bit unfair that google, Amazon, Apple and others just brazenly stole Sonos inventions, sonos did the whole 5 years of court, won, but never really got paid for the heist.",">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? 

>

>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call “the Apple of speakers” remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.

>

>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app — the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.

>

>The missing features — including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries — have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don’t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn’t always go smoothly.

>

>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity — the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.

>

>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand’s reputation. It’s a disaster on par with Apple’s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 — a switch that led to the ouster of the company’s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.

>

>Sonos’ board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app — and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes — the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.

>

>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job — if he wants it.

>

>But with Sonos’ market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion — down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally — the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.

>

>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies’ similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem — just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.

>

>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so — less than it paid for Beats — and it would only cost them a few days’ worth of revenue. Sonos’ hardware could also shore up Apple’s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.

>

>But I don’t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It’s just about wanting to get things done properly — something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.

>

>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees — none of which Apple needs. Sonos’ software is obviously something Apple wouldn’t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.

>

>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn’t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.

>

>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.

>

>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos’ speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.

>

>Sonos’ premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars — two categories the company has explored in the past.

>

>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don’t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.

>

>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.

>

>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn’t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.

>

>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it’s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.

>

>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent — the current goal of the company. With the world’s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It’s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.

>

>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model’s debut. One of Apple’s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE’s replacement. The device — codenamed V59 — will mark the beginning of Apple’s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring — and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.

>

>According to people working in Apple’s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store — and it ships out within a few days — but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.

>

>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won’t keep the current version around — at a reduced price — after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could’ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.

>

>This new iPhone isn’t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 “Donan” chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.

>

>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac — following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.

>

>But there’s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature — which is terrific — but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I’m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.

>

>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.

>

>Apple’s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It’s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you’re walking into Apple thinking you’re going to change how it operates, you’re in for a surprise.

>

>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple’s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.

>

>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface’s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.

>

>Speaking of Apple’s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface’s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O’Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple’s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.

>

>They’re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn’t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple’s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.

**The Schedule**

>Jan. 22 — Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year’s devices aren’t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you’re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.

>

>Jan. 30 — Apple’s first-quarter results. The earnings report — the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh — will give details of Apple’s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.

>**Post Game Q&A**

>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?

>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump’s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple’s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes — ones that Cook himself has championed. But it’s equally clear that Apple may need Trump’s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He’s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world’s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.

>

>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?

>A: The latest earbuds from Apple’s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I’ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.

>

>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?

>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That’s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let’s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn’t suffered major hiccups. Apple’s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.

Most of the world’s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.

>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?

>A: The latest earbuds from Apple’s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I’ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.

>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?

>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That’s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let’s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn’t suffered major hiccups. Apple’s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

Supposedly he’s making great money. TBC, the 20k is the fee and they work for you until you receive your 20k back from profits.

"
2025-01-20,AmazonSeller,"Just think about this: if the company is so confident in their ability to make money, why would they need your $20,000? Why wouldn’t they use their own capital to scale their business and keep all the profits for themselves?

The strategy here is that you give them $20k upfront, but you’re taking on all the risk. You don’t see any profits until they supposedly “return” your $20k investment. And even after that, you’re locked into paying them 30% of the profits indefinitely, which means they have ongoing control over your store.

On top of that, you have no guarantee of success. If they mismanage the store, use shady practices, or violate Amazon’s terms of service, your store could get suspended, and you’d be out of your investment. This seems way too risky and potentially exploitative.

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Always ask yourself why they need your money in the first place.","So, a professional I know told me that he invested $20,000 into a company that does all the purchasing and management of your store.

"
2025-01-20,AmazonSeller,"If they're really that good why don't they just do it for themselves and keep all the profits?

Well.... because it sounds like they are doing RA and will run a account until it gets closed down and it will get closed down that's why they need a constant flow of people to keep opening new accounts for them.

I personally would NEVER give ANYONE access/control of my Amazon account.  Once the account runs into trouble and the Amazon robots shut it down, You're done.  You only get ""one"" Amazon account ever.","So, a professional I know told me that he invested $20,000 into a company that does all the purchasing and management of your store.

2025-01-20,AmazonSeller,"I would proceed with caution:

\- Amazon FBA and drop shipping is a much more riskier business than some will lead you to believe  
\- All else equal, just due to the nature of Amazon, you may never make the $20K back  
\- They're also selling this service to other aspiring Amazon sellers who may even be selling the same products

Doing the research and learning how to run your own Amazon FBA store isn't THAT hard (you just need to read everything you can, and avoid the ""gurus""), and you can have really nicely done merchandising content (Store, PDPs, etc.) done for a fraction of the $20K.","So, a professional I know told me that he invested $20,000 into a company that does all the purchasing and management of your store.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmazonSeller) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Hi everyone. Long story short... I started selling on Amazon almost 20 years ago. I was never a volume seller. I basically just sold books and DVDs. It was a part-time thing with my s corporation and I had basically 100% feedback minus one person who had a problem with the mail. 

Anyway over the years I basically for the most part stopped...aside from 10 active listings which are DVDs. But every week it seems I get new threatening emails. 

First I got one saying that my prices were wrong so they removed half of my listings (they weren't - They were the middle of the price pile for out of print collectible DVD sets). 

Lately I keep getting emails as if I was the one who made the product pages? All I ever did was just search for the movie see the 30 other sellers and then just put mine as the lowest price or one of the lowest prices and just wait for it to sell. 

I never created a product page I never did anything but list of condition I would just describe the product. It seems every week I get policy violation emails I don't even know what for because I don't even really have anything for sale. 

Today's email reads: Listings deactivates due to unauthorized Trademark use. We have taken this measure because we suspect your listing for this product infringes on the intellectual property of others. The product detail page for this product uses the protected trademark term of another rights owner."" What???? I didn't create the product page.

2025-01-21,dividends,"I definitely think you have the right mindset and are on the right path. But a few notes-

I often see portfolios in this sub made up of high yielding crappy companies (yield chasers, don't be one). Stocks typically have a high yield because the stock price has deteriorated. And just because a stock price is down, that doesn't mean it's now a ""buy"". In most cases, capital appreciation (stock price) is more important than dividend yield. 

However, you can play both capital appreciation and dividends. This is essentially what I do. I have rules that I abide by (5 years of dividend growth, and a 5 year dividend cagr of at least 10% (the average annual rate at which the dividend is increased)). There are plenty of solid companies that are not only growing themselves at a high rate, but are also growing their dividend. Capital appreciation + dividend growth over a long period of time is a winner. Look at companies (not financial advice) like Texas Roadhouse, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Costco, Moody's, Broadcom, Wabtec, Microsoft, etc. All of those companies are growing through capital appreciation and dividends. You don't need to have simply growth. Not saying you can't, there's probably nothing wrong with going all in in Google, Amazon, Netflix, Meta, etc. They're all fantastic companies.

But what im getting at is if you're also interested in dividends, you can play both growth and dividends.","I’m fairly new to this subreddit and was pulled in by Reddit’s recommendation.

All our listings appear to have issues with our organic ranking for our main keywords and appear to have tanked within the last year.

We used be #1 or #2 for our main keywords (for example, “water bottle”), whereas we’re now anywhere between 7-10th. As a result, we have had to be more aggressive for these keywords and increase spend on Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brand ads.

* We outsell all our competitors, by a large margin 
* We have 000’s more reviews than the nearest competitor
* We have a higher category rank and BSR than our competitors
* We have a lot of brand equity/awareness outside of Amazon
* We spend a lot more on paid ads than our competitors

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

The concentration of wealth and power among a few mega-monopolies, such as Amazon, only serves to fuel economic instability and exacerbates the deep inequality plaguing our nations.

What is needed is the revitalization of antitrust regulations, a return to tough laws designed to ensure corporate transparency and accountability, and prioritizing small businesses and local economies—the true drivers of economic growth—over the whims of monopolistic giants that stifle competition, innovation, and contradict the principles of a 'free market” by their very existence.

But as they say ""*Good luck with that*"" as at this moment rightwing corruption is so deeply entrenched within all 3 branches of the U.S. gov't it will truly be a miracle if this nation is ever able to extricate from this predominately Republican corporate-fascist nightmare. Still it is a worthy goal to strive towards, imo.

The power to lay off 1,700 workers with a single decision should NEVER rest in the hands of one individual or company. In my view, this is an affront to fairness and underscores why healthy economies require hundreds—if not thousands—of small businesses, rather than a single massive corporation led by a pathologically greedy individual.

>*""The growth of monopolies is a major contributor to the decline of the middle class. When a few large corporations control the entire marketplace, they can set prices, they can set wages, and they can dictate the terms of employment.

2025-01-23,technology,"On December 25th, 2024 Amazon made an update to their policy positions page (https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/our-positions) that combined three paragraphs relating to DEI, Black People, and LGBTQ+ rights into a single paragraph that more concisely expresses the same support.

One month later, irishstar.com published a clickbait article claiming that “Jeff deletes LGBTQ+ rights” that made it to the front page of Reddit.

Reddit then posts thousands of comments in outrage of something that didn’t actually happen.

Here’s the old policy: https://web.archive.org/web/20241002161729/https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/our-positions

> Diversity, equity, and inclusion are good for business—and more fundamentally, they’re simply right. Customers represent a wide array of genders, races, ethnicities, abilities, ages, religions, sexual orientations, military status, backgrounds, and political views. It’s critical that Amazon employees are also diverse and that we foster a culture where inclusion is the norm. Amazon prioritizes equal pay, and since we’ve been measuring and publishing the ratio over the past several years, women have earned between 99.8 and 100.0 cents for every dollar that men have earned in the same jobs. We also believe it’s critical that we increase opportunity for underrepresented groups to enter the technology workforce. We created Amazon Future Engineer, a childhood-to-career computer science education program designed to inspire and educate millions of students globally from underserved communities to pursue careers in computer science. It’s not only that diversity, equity, and inclusion are good for business—it’s more fundamental than that. It’s simply right.

> The inequitable treatment of Black people is unacceptable. We stand in solidarity with our Black employees, customers, and partners, and we are committed to helping build a country and a world where everyone can live with dignity and free from fear. We support legislation to combat misconduct and racial bias in policing, efforts to protect and expand voting rights, and initiatives that provide better health and educational outcomes for Black people.

> The rights of LGBTQ+ people must be protected. We were early and strong supporters of marriage equality and will continue to advocate for protections and equal rights for transgender people. We stand together with the LGBTQ community and are working at the U.S. federal and state level on legislation, including supporting passage of the Equality Act. Amazon provides gender transition benefits based on the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).

And here’s the current policy: https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/our-positions

> We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company that helps us build the best range of products and services for our broad customer base. Amazon customers represent a wide array of geographies, cultures, genders, races, ethnicities, abilities, ages, religions, sexual orientations, military status, backgrounds, and political views. To build the best products and services for our diverse customers, it’s important for our workforce to be diverse, and this drives our commitment to equitable and inclusive employment and business opportunities — from prioritizing equal pay, to creating career pathways, to partnering with small and diverse businesses that help us serve our customers. We also believe that inequitable treatment of anyone—including Black people, LGBTQ+ people, Asians, women, and others—is unacceptable, and we advocate for policies designed to remove barriers to equity and create an inclusive environment for all employees.

2025-01-25,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Amazon did not ""steal your inventory"". That doesnt happen.  Amazon disposed of your inventory because you couldnt prove it was from a legit source. If Amazon started selling the same product after, it had nothing to do with you and the claim they stole it is baseless. They have internal processes for this stuff and there is no possible way they are going to take your questionable inventory and retail it themselves.

According to you. Chances are you arent giving them an invoice and you're giving them a receipt, or they arent able to confirm the supplier on that invoice is legitimate. 9 times out of 10 someone says this, they bought from a retail store or they bought from a liquidator and they are giving amazon a receipt instead of an invoice. They also usually dont have a letter of authorization. You cant just buy whatever you want and resell it.

> Oh and they just somehow happen to sell the same amount of product that was in my accounts FBA inventory?

Yes. Yes thats literally all there is to it. It is delusional to think that theres some splinter cell inside of amazon thats making up nonsense reasons to suspend wholesalers so they can scoop up your questiuonable, possibly counterfeit inventory and then sell it themselves. Amazon is one of the largest companies there is and they can source anything you can source at a better price than you can source it. They dont need or want your sketchy inventory. Amazon has processes and the people who work there follow those processes. Its a huge organization. They can only deviate so much. You are being delusional.","I got deactivated months ago, i have been trying to get it re-activated and no luck.  They say there is an ASIN number counterfeit.

I am a small bus owner- I have a brick and mortar play space/ class space. I am trying to create additional streams of revenue.

One way I want to do that is sell on Amazon the items that we carry in our space. I am clueless so be kind.  How does storefront work? It seems like influencers are selling/ promoting items already sold on Amazon and Amazon fufills them- is this accurate? Do they then get a cut? I’d also like to sell things I’ve made myself.

2025-01-25,smallbusiness,"We started selling on Amazon about two years ago after resisting vehemently. Our business predates Amazon, and our products are pretty unique and specific, so we always figured we weren't really competing with their offerings too much. 

The good: a handful of things we listed have done great. Like 500% more sales than we did through our own online and over years of selling. These products are only a small component of our business so it's not like a life changing revenue difference, but it's clearly given us additional exposure. These products are fairly low cost things, $30-60 items and frankly we never liked dealing with these types of orders in our regular business. By the time you consider taking the order, overhead, storage, shipping etc, it's hard to want to cater to this area of sales when you have bigger orders and clients that are your bread and butter. This can vary depending on your business of course, we just didn't particularly care of the hassle of ""micro"" orders. Amazon FBA on the other hand loves selling small orders and they're happy to deal with the customer service and shipping.

The bad: Their inbound receiving has been an absolute shit show lately. Our last pallet of products shipped out on December 2nd. It's STILL waiting to get checked in and has been delayed twice already. The next ""estimated date"" in now Feb 10. I will be surprised if it makes that date either. 4-6 weeks has been the norm for us generally. This massive delay makes it hard to plan inventory and keep things in stock. They also charge you for storage so you're trying to manage stock levels. For a company that was built on lightning fast prime shipping, their receiving is the worst I've ever seen. 

It can be fairly time consuming to list products and get approvals. This gets easier with some practice but their backend system isn't as intuitive as I would have expected from one of the most successful global companies. Product photos need to be edited in specific ways and you'll inevitably get denied for things that comply etc..It can sometimes take days or weeks to get a product listed as intended.


Product packaging, labeling, and shipping to them can be a little tricky too. Inside boxes, case boxes, pallets...Three levels of labeling. They are very particular about this and adds some unrealized time expense to doublecheck your work or come up with a fool proof process sometimes. 

We will continue doing it begrudgingly although I hate it and part of me would love to boycott them altogether for a number of reasons.","HI Reddit,

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2025-01-30,ecommerce,"Product names don't make best sellers on Amazon, actual sales do and the reviews score for that product.

While an argument can be made that a strong product name may be relevant in returning search results, and that could result in higher sales, the words you have are collected are mostly product details or features and not quite effective based on the very large grouping of best sellers.

Refining your group down to say best selling car covers, and looking for high keyword frequency could prove to be valuable in providing a strong captivating product title for the sale of car covers, or show a popular trending feature that buyers value in car covers.","**Where does this data come from?**

[Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) features a best-sellers listing page for every category, subcategory, and further subdivisions.

I accessed each one of them. Got a total of 25,874 best seller pages.

For each page, I extracted data from the #1 product detail page – Name, Description, Price, Images and more. Everything that you can actually get from the HTML.

There’s a lot of insights that you can get from the data. My plan is to make the raw data public so everyone can benefit from it.

  
**What about the product names?**

Patterns about consumer psychology and market trends can be easily seen in the top keywords. 

The most frequent terms — like ""Pack,"" ""Set,"" ""Black,"" or ""Kid"" — seems to be a language of persuasion. 

These keywords aren’t random at all; most likely they’re strategic tools designed to signal practicality, versatility, or affordability. 

For instance, words like ""Pack"" and ""Set"" subtly emphasize bulk value, while descriptors such as ""Stainless Steel"" or ""Waterproof"" cater to specific buyer priorities.

Here's the top 20 keywords:

1. **Pack**
2. **Set**
3. **Black**
4. **Book**
5. **Stainless**
6. **Steel**
7. **White**
8. **Inch**
9. **Kid**
10. **PC**
11. **Cover**
12. **Tool**
13. **Women**
14. **Light**
15. **Bag**
16. **Accessories**
17. **System**
18. **Home**
19. **Car**
20. **Handle**

Do you think the pattern of frequent terms are just coincidence? Eager to view your opinion in on the comments."

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

# My Current Situation

* We originally used second-hand GS1 barcodes (a budget decision when starting out).
* We’ve now purchased official GS1-registered barcodes.
* Current UPCs are functioning fine across all platforms, but we want to proactively switch to the new ones.

# My Challenge

Amazon’s system seems more complex compared to other sales channels, and I want to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting operations like sales history or inventory management.

# My Proposed Strategy

1. Gradually replace current inventory with FNSKU-labeled items as a temporary solution.
2. Transition to the new GS1 barcodes in phases.
3. Work with Amazon to update product information accordingly.

# 

I’m looking for advice from sellers who’ve successfully navigated this process. Specifically:

* Best practices for transitioning UPCs on Amazon
* Strategies to avoid interruptions during the switch

If you’ve been through this before, I’d greatly appreciate your insights! Thanks in advance.

2025-01-29,AmazonSeller,"This post mentions ungating, category approval, branding, brand approval, invoices, arbitrage, or a commonly related scenario. 

### Amazon policy, info, and enrollment pages

The following Amazon Seller pages are provided to ensure the most accurate info is the basis for discussion

**Brand owner registry** 

* Getting started - https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry    
* Overview - https://sell.amazon.com/blog/what-is-amazon-brand-registry   
* Requirements and eligibility - https://brandservices.amazon.com/brandregistry/eligibility

**Brand seller ungating**

* Category Requirements - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200316110
* Restricted Products - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164330
* Categories and Products requiring approval (see link to video within for invoice requirements) - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200333160) 

---

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

My competitor, which selling the same product as me, fresh account, submitted a forged document to the USPTO, fraudulently transfer ownership of my trademark to himself. The name and address now match his Amazon seller account, and kick me out of my own listing. We contacted USPTO immediately, however uspto told us we need to wait 7 months (totaling 9)to assign an examiner to review to update owner database. 

While It only took my competitor 7 days and $200 fee to process this transfer, meanwhile, the rightful owner must wait nearly a year to fix it. The financial loss is devastating— we are suffering nearly $200,000 loss at our company. 

Since losing my trademark, my listing quality has plummeted, it started receiving negative reviews because my competitor entered my listing to sell counterfeit goods. This has cut off my company cash flow, making us incredibly difficult to pay our employees. While my competitor continues to sit back and profit from our hard work while destroying our listing. 

And the worst part? The signature box on the document was left blank, with only a page of text claiming that I agreed to transfer my trademark. Yet, the USPTO still approved it. I have no idea how something this sloppy got through, but now I’m paying the price.

Even taking legal action feels useless because my competitor is using a fake identity from China, making enforcement nearly impossible. A friend suggested that this could be new blackhat fraud involving an USPTO insider that approve the changes. Which honestly wouldn’t surprise me at this point.

2025-02-01,FulfillmentByAmazon,"This is unfortunately very common. Make sure you are subscribed via email to any alerts or changes to your USPTO reg.

Less common these days, but it used to be very common for people to trademark a competitors brand name to shut them down on Amazon. If you sell a product under your brand name but you havent filed for a trademark, someone else can file for it first. Yes, its illegal, but for a new seller it doesnt make sense to try to fight it.

This still happens with Chinese trademarks. If you have a US trademark, you better get your trademark registered in China too. If you dont, someone else can do it LEGALLY. Once someone has a chinese trademark they can prevent you from exporting from China.

It’s been 2 months since we filed correction declaration to USPTO. Because of this, Amazon is not willing to do anything because the USPTO still listing them as the “current owner.” 

Still fighting to get this resolved. "
2025-01-31,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Good lord that’s awful, I’m so sorry and I look forward to updates. I would definitely contact one of the Amazon attorney specialist and see what kinda of recourse you can seek if anything. That’s unbelievable they passed that through USPTO, I bought a brand from another seller a few years ago and it took us forever to get the trademark transfer done, kept coming back for little things.","Hi everyone, I want to share a deeply unfair blackhat tactics I’m currently facing. My competitor, which selling the same product as me, fresh account, submitted a forged document to the USPTO, fraudulently transfer ownership of my trademark to himself. The name and address now match his Amazon seller account, and kick me out of my own listing. We contacted USPTO immediately, however uspto told us we need to wait 7 months (totaling 9)to assign an examiner to review to update owner database. 

While It only took my competitor 7 days and $200 fee to process this transfer, meanwhile, the rightful owner must wait nearly a year to fix it. The financial loss is devastating— we are suffering nearly $200,000 loss at our company. 

Since losing my trademark, my listing quality has plummeted, it started receiving negative reviews because my competitor entered my listing to sell counterfeit goods. This has cut off my company cash flow, making us incredibly difficult to pay our employees. While my competitor continues to sit back and profit from our hard work while destroying our listing. 

And the worst part? The signature box on the document was left blank, with only a page of text claiming that I agreed to transfer my trademark. Yet, the USPTO still approved it. I have no idea how something this sloppy got through, but now I’m paying the price.

Even taking legal action feels useless because my competitor is using a fake identity from China, making enforcement nearly impossible. A friend suggested that this could be new blackhat fraud involving an USPTO insider that approve the changes. Which honestly wouldn’t surprise me at this point.

Has anyone else encountered something like this? Any advice on how to speed up the process would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Latest Update: Amazon has accepted our infringement notice and prohibited the seller to sell at our listing, Which minimize our losses. However, the seller still controls our brand registry, after he realized he could no longer sell at our listing, he removed all photo of our listing, instead he copied our image and use it as their own. Once we regain control he will likely to use copyright tool to claim content ownership.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

2025-02-01,FulfillmentByAmazon,"When I'm doing VINE, I intentionally put a sale price on that is much lower .. the reason is because even though the Vine Reviewer gets the item for free (technically, they have to pay taxes on the value), they still will comment on the ""value"".  I've seen far too many Vine Reviews that are 1-2 stars because they say 'the product is great, but it's not worth $ dollars"" ... so let the Vine Reviewer get the product with a price displayed on sale.

### The most common reasons for ungating / invoice problems

* **Failure to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, relying on 3rd party info, and stumbling through things asking forgiveness later are all ways to set yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Not understanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a true invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide a properly sourced invoice** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice from 3rd parties** - such as youtube or other online personas posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same. They may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

2025-02-01,AmazonSeller,"Before you go to Amazon, figure out your carrier. For example, you can not ship liquids over 1.0L via Royal mail but OK on the 330m cans. You also need a leakproof inner and outer for shipping liquids via Royal Mail.

2025-02-02,FulfillmentByAmazon,"Amazon is great if you have the margins required (75%+ gross). Once you managed ranking for certain keywords you’ll get constant organic sales. I’d say it’s easier than your own website if it’s a product that already exists in a similar way and is searched for, and you’re creating another new slight variation. For me, it helped me getting that initial demand so I was able to get above comanufacturer MOQ levels.

If you’re creating an entirely new niche that people need to be educated about, I’d say go for your own website & social media marketing instead","Hey everyone. I am planning to start my own business and produce my own products. I will first start with essential oils and then move on to carrier oils, hair care oils and move on to other hair care products if possible. At the moment I can not work with distributors but I think Amazon FBA would be a good place to start. Yet, I would like to hear your opinion too. Some people are quite satisfied whereas others complain about Amazon. I know that some people have bad experiences but please try conclude your mistakes as well."
2025-02-02,FulfillmentByAmazon,"I don’t think the margins will be over %75 (maybe for few products) buy I don’t really think every seller on Amazon makes so much profit. At the beginning I have to make the consumers use the product so I have to give some products FOC. Meaning I won’t make the profit that I am targeting for a while. I just want to increase the orders through selling in different markets so that I can compensate some initial costs. 

I’ll also have my own website to sell but Amazon is the easiest way to be available globally. But is it also using different tactics to kill your profit just like the other e-commerce companies?","Hey everyone. I am planning to start my own business and produce my own products.

## **The right answers, common myths, and misinformation**

Nearly all questions are addressed by Amazon's [**Seller Policies and Code of Conduct**](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G1801), their [**FAQ**](https://sell.amazon.com/learn/faq), and their [**Amazon Seller University**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUG5BEHfTZXPLwSHl4NSy3Q) video course

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable for some items but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

I've been selling an Amazon with FBA for 6 months now and sell an average of 10 units of my product per day, it's suddenly dropped to zero since Friday.

Amazon says nothing is wrong, I have plenty inventory in stock and no actions against my account, every else looks normal, so this really has me questioning if there is a link.

Anyone else experienced a sudden drop in sales since Friday?

Update: 2 Feb 25 14:20 gmt. Got my first sale in days just over and hour ago, BBC news made an update just over an hour ago that Barclays tech issues have been resolved.

So... Coincidence? "

2025-02-02,AmazonFC,"Best thing you can do is stop shopping at Amazon, whenever a company fucks you up mentally or physically the best course of action is finding a new company to find your groceries and packages. Everything Amazon, Walmart or any large retailer sells, gets sold by their competition. And the subscriptions are just a scam to get you to place orders more often oh that monthly sub just hit might aswell order something noooo cancel it, start getting everything elsewhere","I finally turned in my badge and quit yesterday.

2025-02-02,AmazonFC,"Everyone who has to announce that their leaving, in this case on multiple platforms, is usually a weirdo. Telling some close friends who actually care should be enough. I think you’re looking for validation in your decision. Am I supposed to say congratulations? All your troubles are now gone. Should’ve done a leave of absence first to see how things go, and never return. That sounds more cool.

I went on a leave of absence, found something better, never returned and told Amazon to F off. I’d be impressed with that.","I finally turned in my badge and quit yesterday.
